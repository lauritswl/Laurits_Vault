**REFLECTION QUESTIONS**

Text: Louis Althusser (1971) _Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation),_ pages 79-87.

_Write down your answers to the following questions while reading.  
Bring your answers to class._

**Question 1.**
List the differences between the Repressive State Apparatus (RSA) and the Ideological State Apparatus (ISA)? (see page 80-81)

**Question 2.**

Page 82, Althusser presents his concept of ideology in relation to ”what happens to the ”individuals” who live” in it. Find the definition in the text and add it here below.

An individual believes in God, or Duty, or Justice, etc.
This belief derives from the ideas of the individual concerned, i.e. from him as a subject with a consciousness which contains the ideas of his belief.
In this way, i.e. by means of the absolutely ideological “conceptual” device, thus set up, the attitude of the subject concerned naturally follows.

**The individual will derive his beliefs from ISAs, and adopt attitudes and practices of the ISAs that he freely chose to adapt.**






**Question 3.**

P. 82 Altusser advances the hypothesis that ”an ideology always exists in an apparatus, and its practice, or practices. This existence is material”. He goes on to adress what happens to the ”individuals” living in ideology. Althusser presents three ideologies (God, Duty, Justice) and observes a ”schema” which he argues represents the material existance of ideology. Explain, in your own words, how is ideology ”material”?

Ideology might not be as material as e.g. a pavement stone, but it represents and materialises itself in the material world. 
For obvious examples: classroom, cola-bottle, art, history of design etc.

**For the schema**:
The individual will by his "own free will" and "consciousness" feel intrigued to interact with the world. When the individual interacts with ideology, that ideology will influence "his ideas", and the individual will act accordingly to "his own ideas". When acting on these ideas, the ideology will materialise through his actions (prayer, mass, kneeling...).



**Question 4.**

Page 85, Althusser suggests that the concept of _recognition_ can help us understand how ideology functions. How can a hand-shake be a manifestation of recognition? And what about calling somebody by their name (for instance in a class-situation)?


**Quote**:
"it is this knowledge that we have to reach, if you will, while speaking in ideology, and from within ideology we have to outline a discourse which tries to break with ideology, in order to dare to be the beginning of a scientific (i.e. subject-less) discourse on ideology."


**Question 5.**

”Ideology ”transforms” the individuals into subjects (it transforms them all) by that very precise operation which I have called interpellation (…) and which can be imagined along the lines of the most commonplace everyday police hailing; ”Hey, you there!””.  
We find this very quoted passage on interpellation on page 86. How does this call, coming from a police-man, transform the individual into a subject of ideology? Explain in your own wording.


**Explanation**
- The individual is hailed, and is presented with two choises:
***Answer to the hail:***
The individual will react to the hail, and thereby manifest themselves as a part of that ideology. By turning around, the individual also turns themselves into a subject, by materialising the ideology in their actions
***Don't answer the hail*:**
The subject will like answering their hail, also turn themselves into a subject, but instead materialising the non-conforming ideology in their actions.
