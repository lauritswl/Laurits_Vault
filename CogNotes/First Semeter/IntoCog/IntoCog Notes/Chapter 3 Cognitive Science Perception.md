## The nature of perception
Perception is the experiences from stimulation of senses.
#### Perception vs Processing
**Sensation** - the data we receive through stimuli
**Processing** - the translation of the data (stimuli)
**Perception** - the final understanding (conscious understanding) of stimuli

Processing:
[Bottom-up processing]
- Information from the physical stimulus is used to help recognize a stimulus. 
	- Start with small bits of information and combine them to form your perception.

[Top-down processing]
- Information from the general context is used to help recognize a stimulus. 
	- High-level general knowledge contributes to the interpretation of the low-level perceptual units.
