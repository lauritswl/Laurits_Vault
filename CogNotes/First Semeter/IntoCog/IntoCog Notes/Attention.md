# Attention
Types of attention:
[[Selective Attention]]  
-	Paying attention to one thing while ignoring other

**Divided attention**
-	Trying to pay attention to multiple things,

**Attentional capture**
- a shift in attention, caused by an external stimulus


**Visual Scanning** - eye movement from one object to another
**Distraction** - a stimuli catching your  

## Filter model of attention
An early model of attention is Broadbent's (1958) *filter model of attention* - stimuli is filtered, based on attention, at an early stage of processing.

**Shadowing** is an test, where you hear a song/dialog in each ear, and have to paraphrase one of them out loud, to test you attention.

Using shadowing Broadbent made a flow model of attention:

**Terms:**
- **Sensory memory:**
holds all sensory information for fractions of a second, and then transfers it to the filter
- **Attention Filter:**
The filter registers the stimulus' pitch, accent, speed of talking etc. and only lets selected combination of stimuli charateristica pass onto the next stage, as the attended message.  
- **Detector:**
processes the information from the attended message, and derives a meaning from the stimuli, and sends the meaning to our [[short-term memory]]

This is and *early attention model*, because the information is filtered before processing.

### Modifying Broadbent's model - the attenuation model
Moray (1959) tested this model, by having participants **shadow** a conversation, and having the unshadowed dialog mention the participants name. 1/3 of participant detected their name.

This rules out Broadbent's model, as it shows that we partially process information before filtering.
Its not your name, but also the meaning of the dialog that can divide your attention.

see the "Dear Aunt Jane experiment", where its the meaning of the dialog, and not the physical attributes of voices, that decide what participants attended to:
**Right Ear**: Dear --> 8 --> Jane
**Left Ear**: 7 --> Aunt --> Jane
**Shadowed dialog** = "Dear Aunt Jane"

This points towards the filter being a "leaky filter"

Broadbent model of attention then got updated, to Treisman's attenuation model:

## Modern studies: Processing capacity and perceptual load
The idea that the ability to selectively attend to a task can depend both on the distracting stimulus and on the nature of the ongoing task.
![[Perceptual capacity.png]]
### Processing capacity
the amount of information people can handle and process at a given time
### Perceptual load
the difficulty of a task (attention required)

It seems that we have some **early unconscious filtering**, but depending on the remaining processing capacity after the task is done, we also let other information through the filter, that we then filter in a **later more selective conscious filter**.
After this "conclusion", attention research moved onto researching different kinds of attention types.
___
# Visual attention types
## Overt attention
Switching attention by moving eyes - your visual attention is mostly based on your central vision, as we have a hard time identifying items in our peripheral vision

Both Overt and covert attention can be influenced by **stimulus salience** (the physical properties of the stimulus)
When deciding where we put our attention, we quickly create a **salience map** of an image.

**Saliance map examples**

## Covert attention
Switching attention without moving eyes


### Posner's two types of cues:
#### Endogenous cues
- Active, topdown, goal- directed, intentional
- e.g. ‚Äúattend to the 4th sound in a sequence‚Äù

#### Exogenous cues
- Passive, bottom-up, stimulus driven,s incidental
- e.g. an unpredicted change ‚Äúcatches‚Äù your attention: be be be be be ba be

# Attention in Cognitive Science
## Quantitative limits
There are limits to the amount of information in the world that the mind can attend to and process simultaneously.

[Serial bottlenecks]
When you can't perceive all the available information in parallel, and automatically filters the most important stimuli.

### Filtering of attention:
 Attention-selection is influenced by:
- If anything *is standing out in our the semantic field* of our surrounding, it receives **more attention**. (endogenous)
- If we have a task at hand, the *estimated important information* receive **more attention**. (exogenous)

# Cognitive Control - directive attention
**Definition**: The ability to control you cognitive functions ("executive functions")

Cognitive functions are located in the frontal lobe
- Attention, memory and other cognitive processes

**Cognitive load** = relative difficulty of the cognitive task

- Different from **perceptual** load (how much you can take in through your senses)
- Different from **processing capacity** (the capacity of how much cognitive load, you can process)

## Binding Problem
**Binding**
- integrating the sensations of color, shape, texture, etc to perceive an object. The features of sensation are bound together before processing the object.

"*The binding problem*"
All of these sensations are bound together to one perception, but what is the thing we bind these sensations to?:
