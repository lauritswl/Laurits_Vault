## Perception vs Processing
**Sensation** - the data we receive through stimuli
**Processing** - the translation of the data (stimuli)
**Perception** - the final understanding (conscious understanding) of stimuli

[Bottom-up processing]
- Information from the physical stimulus is used to help recognize a stimulus. 
	- Start with small bits of information and combine them to form your perception.

[Top-down processing]
- Information from the general context is used to help recognize a stimulus. 
	- High-level general knowledge contributes to the interpretation of the low-level perceptual units.


Visual Perception - in the brain:
Visual cortex --> "Where" pathway" --> parietal lobe
Visual cortex --> "What" pathway" --> temporal lobe
![[Visual Perception - in the brain.png]]

Visual Agnosia - is the inability to recognize visual objects
Divided into two types:
	Apperceptive = cannot recognize shapes
	Associative = cannot recognize complex objects

## Perceiving depth and surfaces:
**Texture gradient** 
	> Elements tend to appear more closely packed together as the distance from the view increases.
**Stereopsis**
	> The ability to perceive 3D because two eyes receive slightly different view of the world.
**Motion parallax**
	>Provides 3D information when an object is in motion
	>As more distant points move they will move more slowly across the retina than closer points.
	
**2½D sketch**
	>Identifies where various visual features are located relative to the viewer
	>Occurs before 3D sketches are processed

## [[Gestalt principles]] of organization 
Principles/laws of human perception that describe how humans group similar elements.
“Gestalt” is German for “unified whole”.

## Helmholtz's theory
How does the perceptual system perceive patterns:
	> Likelihood principle = we recognize an object to be what is most likely (from experience)
	> Unconscious inference = the process of unconscious assumptions

## Object recognition (from patterns)
### Recognition-by-components theory (Biederman - from gestalt)
Classical approch, consisiting of 3 stages:
	- The object is segmented into a set of basic subobjects
	 - Then, the category of each subobject is classified
		 - 36 categories (geons)
	 - Having identified the pieces out of which the object is composed and their configuration, one recognizes the object as the pattern composed from these pieces
### Regularities (assumptions influence perception)
**Physical regularities**
	 - Oblique effect = horizontals and verticals occur more often, so oblique (diagonal) angels are harder to perceive
	 - Light-from-above assumption
**Semantic regularities**
	 - Semantic regularities = functions common to a scene
	-  Scene schema = Knowledge of what a scene typically contains

## Bayseian interference
Prior probability [the prior] = our beliefs about the probability of an outcome (more extensive than Helmholtz).
