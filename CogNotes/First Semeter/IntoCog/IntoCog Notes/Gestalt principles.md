## Principles regarding how we perceive things at first. 
---
## Principle of proximity
We perceive things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.
## Principle of similarity
We perceive object that are similar to each other as a unified group.

## Principle of good continuation
When we don't have vision of a line, it follows the path of least change.
## Principle of closure
We prefer complete shapes, so we automatically fill in gaps between elements to perceive a complete image.

## Principle of pragnance 
(**law of good figure** or the law of simplicity)
when you're presented with a set of ambiguous or complex objects, your brain will make them appear as simple as possible
