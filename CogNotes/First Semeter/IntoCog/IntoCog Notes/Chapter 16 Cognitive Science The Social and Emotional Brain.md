**Emotions** are an internal signpost:
A state associated with stimuli that are **rewarding** (*i.e., that one works to obtain*) or **punishing** (*i.e., that one works to avoid*). 
These stimuli often have an inherent survival value

```ad-example
title: SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF EMOTIONS
- Emotions are short-termed in nature (unlike a **mood**, which is where an emotional state becomes extended over time), although the emotional status of stimuli is stored in [[Long-term memory (LTM)]].
- An **emotional stimulus** directs attention to itself, to enable more detailed evaluation or to **prompt a response**.
- Emotions have a **hedonic value**; that is, they are subjectively **liked or disliked**.
- Emotions have a particular ‚Äú**feeling state**‚Äù in terms of an internal bodily response (e.g., sweating, heart rate, hormone secretion).
- Emotions elicit particular external motor outcomes in the face and body, which include emotional **expressions**

Contemporary models of emotion differ with respect to whether there are a finite number of discrete emotions or whether there is a continuous range of emotional processes but with categories of emotion being constructed through interactions with nonaffective processes (e.g., appraisal, language).

Different regions of the ‚Äúemotional brain‚Äù have different
functions, although these functions do not precisely map onto discrete categories of emotion (such as fear, happiness, etc.). 

The amygdala has a key role in emotional learning and memory (e.g., fear conditioning); the insula and anterior cingulate have key roles in bodily related aspects of emotion experience; the orbitofrontal cortex is crucial for the appraisal and control of social and emotional stimuli; and the ventral striatum has a key role in reward prediction.

The functions of the emotional brain described above operate in both the social realm (e.g., when the stimuli consist of
conspecifics) and the nonsocial realm.

Recognizing facial expressions, processing eye gaze and
recognizing facial identity depend on different neural
mechanisms. The superior temporal sulcus is particularly
important for gaze detection, whereas recognizing expressions depends, at least in part, on simulating the affective and sensorimotor components of that expression.

Mirroring (and simulation theory) is an important aspect of
explaining empathy, but there is more to empathy than this.
Empathy is modulated by social knowledge of others and may also require a mentalizing component.

People with autism may lack a theory of mind mechanism, but impaired theory of mind alone cannot explain the full pattern of strengths and weaknesses in autism. It is unclear whether theory of mind is the core deficit in autism or whether a defective mirror system is the core deficit.

Thinking about the mental states of others involves a core
network of regions (including the temporoparietal junction
and medial prefrontal cortex) that differ from those involved
in executive functions more generally, or involved in emotional
evaluation or person perception. Whether it is a domain-specific module remains contested.
