## Categorizing knowledge
### Conceptual knowledge
Knowledge that enables you to recognize and understand objects around you is called **conceptual knowledge**  
**Concepts** = "what animals is a cat"

Knowledge that enables you to recognize the meaning/traits of objects, events and ideas is called **semantic knowledge**.  
**Semantics** = What are the properties and behaviors of a cat?

### Prototype approach: Finding the average case

According to the _prototype approach to categorization_, membership in a category is determined by comparing the object to a prototype that represents the category. **A prototype** is a "typical" member of the category.

| Effect             | Description                                                                                       | Experimental result                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Family resemblance | Things in a category resemble each other in a number of ways.                                     | Higher family resemblance or more attributes in common for high-prototypical items (Rosch, 1975a)                                                                   |
| Typicality         | People react rapidly to members of a category that are "typical" of the category                  | Faster reaction time to statements like "A X is a bird" for high-prototypical items like robin) than for low prototypical items (like ostrich) (Smith et al., 1974) |
| Naming             | People are more likely to list some objects than others when asked to name objects in a category. | High-prototypical items are named first when people list examples of a category (Mervis et al., 1976)                                                               |
| Priming            | Presentation of one stimulus affects responses to a stimulus that follows.                        | Faster same-different judgments for high prototypical items (Rosch, 1975b)                                                                                                                                                                |

### The exemplar approach: Thinking about examples
Exemplars are actual members of the category that a person has encountered in the past.
As opposed to the prototype approach's normative rating, the fastest objects to categorize is the ones with the biggest number of resembling exemplars.

==**Prototype vs Exemplar**==
When we learn about a new category we use both the prototype and exemplar approach. However when we get more used to the category, we mainly use exemplar, so its easier to categorize outliers like "ostriches" and "penguins" in the bird category.
Some research indicates that exemplar works best for smaller categories, whilst prototype work better for larger categories.


## Psychologically privileged level of categories
### Hierarchical organization of levels of categories
**Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson and Boyes-Braem (1976)'s: 3 levels of categories**
![[Privileged categories.png]]
The more knowledge we have of an object, the more specific the categorization will be. When we refer to somthing, we tend to use the basic category.
## Representing relationships between categories: Semantic networks
### The semantic network approach
Semantic networks is a visualization of the memories hierarchical categories and associations, with more specific categories at the bottom. 

##### How semantic networks are created
Semantic networks are produced by asking participants to answer "yes or no" to questions.
It should take participants longer to answer "is a rose a living thing" than "is a rose a flower", this allows us to determine the hierarchy of the categories in the network. This also means that the longer you have to travel in the semantic network, the longer it takes to answer the question.

The semantic network approach describes how we save memory capacity by [[Short-term memory (STM)#^chunking|chunking]] traits to different levels of categories .
This way of storing shared properties just once at a higher-level node Is called [cognitive economy].

#### Spreading activation
Spreading activation is activity that spreads out along any link that is connected to an activated node. 
For example, "Robin" gets mentioned, and spreading activation activates bird, and primes connecting nodes:

## Representing concepts in networks: The connectionist approach
Criticism of semantic networks, combined with advances in understanding how information is represented in the brain, led to the emergence of a new approach to explaining how knowledge is represented in the mind.

### The connectionist approach
![Connectionist approach](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Artificial_neural_network.svg/1200px-Artificial_neural_network.svg.png)
>Incoming stimuli, activate the input units, and signals travel through the network, activating the hidden and output units.

Connection weight determines how signals sent from one unit either increase or decrease the activity of the next unit.

Activation of output units in a network therefore depends on two things

1.  the signal that originates in the input units and
2.  the connection weights throughout the network.

```ad-example
title: The following results also support the idea of connectionism

!!! ad-info
	title: Resistant to physiological damage
	Because information In the network is distributed across many units, damage to one part of the brain doesn't destroy memory completly. 
	This theory of **graceful degradation** is simmilar to actual cases of brain damage, in which the brain only looses partial function.

!!! ad-info
	title: Can explain generalization of learning
	Because similar concepts have similar patterns, training a system to recognize the **properties of one **concept also **provides information about other** related concepts.
	This means by learning about canaries, we are able to predict traits about other birds.
```

## Script theory, Schank & Abelson (1977):
All memory is episodic 

**Can have generalized episodic memories**
- Memory of a type of event
- Memory of how that event usually goes 
- Called a script

**Scripts function as schemata**
- Scripts organise new inputs 
- Scripts reconstruct memories

==Scripts can be used to fill gaps in memory== – *these assumptions come from your **cultural scripts**, and are not universal!*
