Please give a summary of chapter 4 (Attention) in Goldstein & van Hoof, including illustrative experimental examples.


Title:
Cognitive Science: Studying the mind
___
Page search: 74-111
See also: [[Attention]]
___


Recap:

## 1: Selective attention
The ability to focus on one message whilst ignoring others

## 2: Attentional models
**Broadbent's filter model** of attention
(sensory memory, attention filter, detector)
-->
Moray 1959 "Dear Aunt Jane experiment"
-->
**Treiman's attention model**

## 4: Modern studies: Processing capacity and perceptual load
![[Perceptual capacity.png]]
We have **early unconscious filtering**, but depending on remaning perceptual capacity more will be let through, for **later more selective conscious filter**.

Thus high load tasks = high attention
too high load =/= high attention

## 5: Trouble with late selection
A high load may be responsible for lack of ability to make late selection filtering


# Types of visual attention
## Overt attention
Switching attention by moving our eyes -
Attention is often based on central vision
Decided by 
bottom-up **stimulus salience** (properties of stimulus, such as colour, contrast or movemen) and 
top-down scene schemas and task demand.

## Covert attention
Switching attention without moving our eyes

### Posner's two types of cues:
#### Endogenous cues
- Active, topdown, goal- directed, intentional
- e.g. ‚Äúattend to the 4th sound in a sequence‚Äù

#### Exogenous cues
- Passive, bottom-up, stimulus driven,s incidental
- e.g. an unpredicted change ‚Äúcatches‚Äù your attention: be be be be be ba be

## Scanning
Saccadic eye movement - rapid jerky eye movement from one fixation to another

(combination of covert and overt attention)

What we look for when we scan is decided by:
Bottom-up stimuli salience
Top-down "knowledge" factors or task demands

## Divided attention
Divided attention is possible for easy tasks or for highly practised difficult tasks.

Cognitive load of the task varies how easy we can divert attention.
E.g. driving cars is an easy physical task, but multitasking with processes creating cognitive loads will cause you to have less focus on the road.

## Binding
A rolling ball will be perceived in parts, and the later turned into a ball.
Feature integration theory explains how binding occurs by proposing two stages of processing, preattentive processing and focused attention.
