# Emotions and Cognition
**Emotions** are an internal signpost:
A state associated with stimuli that are **rewarding** (*i.e., that one works to obtain*) or **punishing** (*i.e., that one works to avoid*). 
These stimuli often have an inherent survival value.

It's a way to tagging certain stimuli to ensure that they receive priority treatment and are responded to appropriately.

We can  engage in **nonaffective cognitive control** to guide behavior without only relying on "gut feeling".

**mentalizing** (The process of attributing mental states to others) is a rather different brain network than emotions.

## Theories of emotion
```ad-example
title: SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF EMOTIONS
- Emotions are short-termed in nature (unlike a **mood**, which is where an emotional state becomes extended over time), although the emotional status of stimuli is stored in [[Long-term memory (LTM)]].
- An **emotional stimulus** directs attention to itself, to enable more detailed evaluation or to **prompt a response**.
- Emotions have a **hedonic value**; that is, they are subjectively **liked or disliked**.
- Emotions have a particular ‚Äú**feeling state**‚Äù in terms of an internal bodily response (e.g., sweating, heart rate, hormone secretion).
- Emotions elicit particular external motor outcomes in the face and body, which include emotional **expressions**

```
### "The Somatic Marker Hypothesis"
Rationality is colored by emotions:
Memories are stored with an emotional evaluation, a "**somatic marker**"
Retrieving that event reinstates the **somatic marker** and this guides behavior (e.g. making a response more or less likely)
**Somatic markers** may be unconscious or conscious.

### Kahnemans dual system theory:

| Type 1 process (intuitive)      | Type 2 process                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Does not require working memory | Requires working memory                  |
| Autonomous                      | Cognitive decoupling, mental stimulation |
| Fast                            | Slow                                     |
| High capacity                   | Capacity limited                         |
|                                 |                                          |



### James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theory
(James,1884)  According to the James‚ÄìLange theory of emotion, it is the self-perception of bodily changes that produces emotional experience

(Cannon, 1927) - emotions could be accounted for solely within the brain and that bodily responses occur *after* the emotion itself

### Papez circuit and the limbic brain
Papez (1937) drew upon the work of [[Emotions and Cognition#James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theory|James-Lange]], and theorized a limbic-based circuit, that turned stimuli into emotion.

### Contemporary views of emotion: categories, dimensions and appraisals
The **dominant alternative view** to that of an undifferentiated ‚Äú*limbic brain*‚Äù  is to postulate different categories of emotion (e.g., fear, anger, disgust).

In one approach, called the **basic emotions approach** (Ekman, 1992), there are postulated to be a small number of distinct emotions, shaped by evolutionary needs:
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Disgust 
- Anger 
- Fear 
- Surprise

Barrett (2006): a ‚Äúcore affect‚Äù system that is organized along two dimensions corresponding to pleasantness and arousal:
![[Feldman-Barett emotion core affect.png]]

#### Anger
For food
To defend offspring
To win a mate
To scare off a potential adversary (*opponent in a fight*)

```ad-tip
title: Hypothalamus and Anger
The **hypothalamus** is located in the **center** of the brain (old type 1 process)
- If you stimulate the** medial hypothalamus** you get **affective aggression** (theat attack/showing off)
- If you stimulate the **lateral hypothalamus** you get **predatory aggression** (silent attack)




```

## Neural substrates of emotion processing

Emotion is everywhere, but mostly in the: 
- **amygdala** and 
- **cingualte cortex**.

Amygdala is the main culprit in emotion, it receives input from all sensory modalities. If you damage your amygdala, you don't learn from emotions. 

The amygdala activates both with unpleasant stimuli and pleasant stimuli (it does activate more to unpleasant stimuli though). --> plays a role in coding of emotional intensity and certain aspects of reward learning

There is a fast route to the amygdala: 
![[Snake in brain.png]]
Stimuli --> Visual Thalamus --> Visual cortex --> Amygdala


### Dopamine - The reward transmitter
![[Dopamine.png]]
- Striatum (**dopamineric** regions - dopamine receivers):
	- Nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum)
	- Caudate and others (dorsal striatum)

- Brain stem: production
	- Ventral tegmental area (dopamine production)
	- Raphe nuclei (seretonin production)

If rats get to self stimulate their striatum, they will keep on doing it, and create habits.
The most effective sites for self stimulation fell along the trajectory of dopaminergic axons arising in the ventral tegmental area.

# Social cognition
## Empathy
An emotional reaction to another person‚Äôs feelings.
### Mirror Neurons
Mirror neurons are¬†**a class of neuron that modulate their activity both when an individual executes a specific motor act and when they observe the same or similar act performed by another individual**. ^MirrorNeuron
#### Monkey research
**Mirror Neuron System:** (found in motor areas)
- Formed of neurons activated when animals perform an action and when they observe another performing the same action
These mirror neurons activations got over interpreted to be the basis of social cognition.

#### Do humans have mirror neurons as well?
We cant do single neuron research on **humans**, but we can look at **areas**:

Regions that respond similarly when **performing an action** or **watching others perform it**:
- Ventral premotor cortex 
- Anterior intraparietal cortex 
- Superior intraparietal cortex
However, these are entire areas, NOT neurons.

Mirror neurons are might be [[The embodied approach|Embodiment]].

## Understanding others minds
### Theory of Mind: False belief task
> **Where will sally look?**

| Sally will look in the basket                   | Sally will look in the box                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| You are able to reason for others mental states | You are **not** able to reason for others mental states |
| Will be answered by children **4+ years old**   | Will be answered by children **less than 4 years old**  | 

![[Theory of Mind.png]]

Human have theory of mind in situation where its to the other persons benefit. Primates only have it in competitive context. 

### System 1 & 2 empathy
| System 1 - Affective empathy                                                                                                                    | System 2 - Cognitve empathy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Our reaction to gore pictures                                                                                                                   | Our "theory of mind" etc.                                                                                                    |
| **Affective empathy** is thought to rely on **automatic emotional contagion** (Hatfield et al. 2009) which may rely on the mirror neuron system | **Cognitve empathy** is thought to rely on ‚Äú**mentalizing**‚Äù (Frith & Frith 2007) - the knowledge of other peoples thoughts. |


### Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts:
- **Theory of mind deficits**
	- Learns theory of mind later in life, and a weaker understanding of others mental states 
- **Weak central coherence**
	- processing of parts takes precedence over processing of wholes.
