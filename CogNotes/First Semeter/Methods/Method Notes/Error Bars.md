## Concept
[[Error Bars]] are normally plotted in 3 ways:
![[Error bars overview.png]]

### Standard Deviation:
$$\sigma/s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_1-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}$$
Measure of variability in the sample

### Standard Error (of the mean)
The standard error is an approximation of how well the sample mirrors the population.
$$Standard Error = \frac{\sigma \text{(standard deviation)}}{\sqrt{n  \text{(datapoints)}}}$$

### Confidence Intervals
When you have standardized your data:

You can then plot your confidence interval as error bars.
These error bars will always be bigger than standard error.
Confidence interval error bars describe how big a % of population is between the top and bottom of the bar. (usually 95%)
