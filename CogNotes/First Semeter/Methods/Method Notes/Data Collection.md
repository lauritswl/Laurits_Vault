## Population vs Sample
[Population] = The exhaustive collection of units which we want to generalize our findings (all of the population) 
N = The size of the exhaustive population 
Î¼ = The mean of the populations data
Ïƒ = Standard deviation

[Sample] = A smaller collection of units extracted from the population on which we can practically test our hypotheses 
n = The size of the sample (sample size)
xÌ„ = The mean of the sample data
s = Standard deviation of sample


## Hypothesis
H_0 (null hypothesis) = no difference between the means
H_1 (alternative hypothesis) = difference between the means

Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): we canâ€™t prove the H1, but we can reject the H0


We need a systematic variance, rather than unsystematic variance, to be able to conclude anything. You need statistics to differentiate between these variances.

### 5 types of data:
**Categorical**:
- Binary/Logical (frequency)
- Nominal (frequency)
- Ordinal (frequency + order)
**Continuous**
- Interval (full arithmetic)
- Ratio (full arithmetic)

Normal Distribution:
[[Lecture_2_Data_collection.pdf]] - Page 14:19
Kurtosis = how pointy the distrubution is


Pointy = Leptokurtic (k>0)
Flat = Platykurtic (k<0)
Normal distrubution = k=0

Bimodal distribution has 2 most frequent values, is often 2 normal distributions. (Bimodality)

Given a population with unknown underlying distribution, **the sampling distribution of the sample means** will approximate the normal distribution

### Error --> Deviance
In every data collection, when we try to make a model there will be errors:
![[Error for data collection.png]] - from page 16 of 
[[Lecture_3_Building_statistical_models.pdf]]

The error is called d eviance.
Deviance = outcome-mean

We describe the deviance with standard deviation:
![[Standard Deviation.png]] 

Smaller standard deviation make the sample more representative of the model.

### Common problems with data

### Full-experiments vs Quasi-experiments
Quasi = Collection of data about two or more naturally occurring variables in the world/ lab (= correlation)
Full-experiments = Variables are manipulated systematically to observe changes in their relation
