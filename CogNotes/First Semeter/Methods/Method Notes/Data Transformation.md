# Linear Transformation

**Linear transformations**
- Changes numbers without changing the relation between them

**Centering** 
- A linear transformation, where you subtract  the mean of variable from each datapoint, to see how much that particular dateset deviates. The descriptive nature of the datasets 0, is now a different.

**Standardizing** (z-scoring)
To standardize you have to **center your data**, and then **divide** it by the **standard deviation**. Then you have your datapoints described as how many standard deviations it's from the mean. ^abf63b

**Correlation coefficient** -
If you standardize both the x- and y value, you get a person's (phenomons') r, the correlation coefficient.
$$R^2 $$ is actually the squared coefficient

(if its a negative skew, you can de a reverse transformation, to make it a positive skew)
