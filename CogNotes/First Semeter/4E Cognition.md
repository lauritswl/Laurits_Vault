# 4E Cognition
[[Perception]]

## Cognition is embodied, embedded, extended, & enacted

1) **Embodied**
	- other body processes affect cognition (includes emotion, which is a physiological process)
2) **Embedded**
	- social and environmental contexts influence cognition (includes culture)
3) **Enacted**
	- your actions are influenced by your cognitive processes (e.g., you donâ€™t remember something, so you ask me about it)
4) **Extended**
	- people influence each otherâ€™s cognitive processes (e.g., you are paying attention to this slide because Iâ€™m talking to you â€“ Iâ€™m directing your attentional processes)
