## The representation of concepts in the brain
4 most prominent approaches, mostly studied in patients with physiological brain damage.
### Sensory functional hypothesis (S-F hypothesis)
**Got introduced by studying *category-specific memory impairment***
Category-specific memory impairment = injury caused a loss to the ability to identify one type of object
- Patients couldnâ€™t identify living animals, but could identify artefacts.
- This mad recearchers think that we identify different objects in different ways:
	- Features (animals) vs. functions (artefacts)

==Sensory-functional hypothesis== = we use semantic memory to distinguish between features and functions

### Semantic category approach (domain specific approach)
==Semantic category approach== = specific neural circuits are dedicated to specific categories; e.g. faces, places, bodies etc.

```ad-quote
title: Mahon and Caramazza (2011)
"there are innately determined patterns of connectivity that mediate in the integration of information from the ventral stream with information computed by other brain regions" (p. 97).

	title: Mahon & Caramazza (2011)
	So, for example, the lateral **fusiform face area** (FFA) is specialized in the processing of faces because this brain region has innately **strong connections** with, among other areas, **the amygdala **and the **superior temporal sulcus**, which are involved with the processing of **social and motion information** respectively 
```

### Multiple-factor approach
==Multiple-factor approach== = many dimensions make up every object 
- Our cognitive organization may reflect multiple dimensions of similarity.
Crowding = many objects share similar features (e.g., eyes, legs etc)

Hoffman and Lambon Ralph (2013) experiment:

			 
| A:     A few of the 160 items presented to participants |           |          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Mammal                                                  | Machine   | Clothing |
| Pet                                                     | Vehicle   | Weapon   |
| Bird                                                    | Furniture | Tool     |
| Door                                                    | Fish      | Fruit    |

**B: Question for Participants**

| Colour      | Taste                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual form | Smell                                                    |
| Motion      | Tactile (touch)                                          |
| Sound       | Performed action (in which you interact with the object) |

The results showed many of the same results as the S-F hypothesis, as animals and artefacts score different on almost all parameters. Some artefacts scored very similarly to animals on multiple factors, such as cars and musical instruments that had factors such as movement and sound (communication).

### [[The embodied approach]]
**Embodied approach** = Knowledge of concepts is determined by our motor-sensory interactions with objects
Regions of the brain related to perception activate for both the image of a hammer and the word hammer, aswell as motor areas that are involved with carrying a hammer is activated

An *important difference* with the **category specific approach** is that the activated circuits are not innate but are established during **learning and experience.**

We have what are called **mirror neurons** in the premotor cortex, that activate both when we do an action, or when we see someone else do that action. The mirror neurons a specialized to a single action.
