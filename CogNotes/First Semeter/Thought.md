##  What is thought
```ad-quote
title: Eysenck and Keane’s (2015) Cognitive Psychology: A Student’s Handbook, p. 429
“our ability to reflect in a complex way on our lives, to plan and solve problems that arise on a daily basis, is the bedrock of thinking behaviour”
```
We tend to be aware of the products of thought rather than the process.
Jacobsen (1932) found electrical activity in people’s throat muscles when they were asked to think. 
Smith et al. (1947): Smith got injected with a local muscle relaxant in his a , that doesn't affect the CNS (central nervous system). In the 20 minutes it was active, he couldn't think words or do math.

### Classical cognitivism
Mind as a computer metaphor, thinking is manipulation of abstract symbols, based on formal logic (IF X do Y).
#### Jerry Fodor - "The language of thought hypothesis" (LOTH)

Is the idea that thinking takes place in a "mental language" = ==mentalese==.
[[Universal Language|Mentalese]] is a complex combinatorial algorithm:

Thought has (or rather is) syntax, so the thought "John is tall" is composed of two sub-parts: 
[John], [talnlness] -> tJ

Likewise:
"John kissed Mary" -> kiss[SubjectJohn,ObjectMary]




### [[The embodied approach|Embodied]] cognitive science

We encode modal information in mental representations.
Thinking is by that logic multimodal (visual, tactile, auditory, olfactory, etc), as we mentally visualize two different eagles with the "the eagle in the sky" and "the eagle in the nest".
Linguistic and non-linguistic representations interact, when we talk about a nasty taste, we can almost feel it.
Culture-specific (e.g. linguistic relativity)




## Is language development dependent on cognitive development?
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) interested in the structure of origin of human knowledge.
Jean Piaget's developmental stages:
![jean-piaget-stages.jpg (706×461) (papermasters.com)](https://www.papermasters.com/images/jean-piaget-stages.jpg)
Jean Piaget's research along with others (Flavell et al., 2002) suggest that children only can think of, what their cognitive world view is able to process.
fx a child that has no idea of object permanence, doesn't have the cognitive ability to understand words such as "more" or "gone".
The causality is not defined though, so it may also be the words, that unlocks object permanence.

A lot of studies have debunked this, by showing re-creatable cases of low IQ, or different cognitive development, with language of the same level as neurotypical children.


## Is language development dependent on social development?
Children seem to use self monologue, when talking to others, and when alone. Maybe as a way to practice, or because of their ego-centrism.

See [[{p} Lev Vygotsky|Lev Vygotsky]] as an alternative to Piaget's ideas of thought acquisition. 


## Is language one-way or bidirectional: (The Whorfian hypothesis)
The idea that language determines thought is called *linguistic determinism*
The idea that differences between languages will lead to differences in ways of thinking is called *linguistic relativism*
However, the terms “linguistic relativism” and “determinism” are often used interchangeably, creating a bidirectional link between language and thought.

"the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation" (Sapir E. 1929:207)
"Language is not simply a reporting device for experience but a defining framework for it” (Whorf & Carroll, 1956:252)



### Examples of thoughts being influenced by language

Experiments show that subjects perform better at math, if the problem is in the language they are taught. 
--> This dilemma of  understanding the world becomes very clear when talking about different languages words:
Names for colors in different languages:

Being brought up with a different set of categorical colors, decide how fast you are to determine the color.
