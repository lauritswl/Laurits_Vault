AMODAL SYMBOL SYSTEM 
- Elements within the system are inherently non- perceptual. 

PERCEPTUAL SYMBOL SYSTEM 
- All information is represented in terms that are modality specific and basically perceptual. 
	- DUAL-CODE THEORY Information is represented in combined verbal and visual codes.

## Script theory, Schank & Abelson (1977):
All memory is episodic 

**Can have generalized episodic memories **
- Memory of a type of event
- Memory of how that event usually goes 
- Called a script

**Scripts function as schemata **
- Scripts organise new inputs 
- Scripts reconstruct memories

==Scripts can be used to fill gaps in memory== â€“ *these assumptions come from your **cultural scripts**, and are not universal!*

Script theory somewhat mirrors [[Semantic Network#Cognitive economy|cognitive econonomy]] / [[Short-term memory (STM)#^chunking|chunking]] as a broad memory theory.
