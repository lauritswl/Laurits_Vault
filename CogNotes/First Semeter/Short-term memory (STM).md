# Intro to STM
As mentioned in Atkinson and Shillrin's [[Memory_Overview]] we receive an input of stimuli, this stimuli is filtered by what we focus our attention on in our sensory memory. The relevant information is then stored in our STM. 

**[Sensory Memory]** can only retain memory for fractions of a second. *Persistence of vision* is an example, where images linger after we see them, e.g. an a sparklers trail of light in the dark. *Echoic memory* is the persistence of a sound in our memory.

STM only *retains 5-7 meaningful items* of memory for about 15-20 seconds. You can then retain information in the STM for extended periods of time by **rehearsing** it. These 5-7 items reflect a "meaningful unit" or "chunk" that can be multiple words/things. ^555d6f

Keppel and Underwood (1962) suggest that the reason we get worse at remembering information is due to:
1) **Proactive interference** - interference that occurs when old learned information interferes with learning new information. 
2) **Retroactive interference** -  interference that occurs when newly learned information interferes with old information.

In regards to the est. 5-7 chunks of information the STM can retain, most people utilize "**chunking**" to expand the size of information they can retain. In praxis chunking would be remembering STM as *short-term memory*, instead of 3 letter chunks. ^chunking

The amount of data we can store in our short term memory depends not on how many *items* but how on the *amount of information*. We are therefore able to remember more one colored squares than 3dimensional shaded cubes.

# Working Memory 
**Working memory** is an alternative way of defining STM, it was introduced by _Baddeley and Hitch (1974)_. It is defined as following:"a limited-capacity system for temporary storage **and manipulation of information for complex tasks such as comprehension, learning and reasoning**". It therefore differs by also *limiting the storage-capacity* of information *based on how big a task* we need to do at the same time.

The working memory is composed of these 3 components :
- The phonological loop 
- The visuospatial sketch pad
- **The central executive**
