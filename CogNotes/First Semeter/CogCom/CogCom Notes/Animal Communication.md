# Animal Communication
## Recap: the act of communication:

___
Sender --> (meaning) --> reciever

- The sender has an intention to communicate, a message.
- The **sender** sends a shared code (icon, index, symbol), to the **reciever** who has his own understanding/interpretation. 
- The reveiver can send feedback
- The sender can modify their communication with recipient design, to make the interpretation more accurate of the intended meaning
- Common ground is important for communication, to have the same context and ideas, to minimize communication

## Why do we care about animal communication
Based on the comparative approach, we can get knowledge about human communication, by studying the differences to animal communication.

--> The synchronic perspective vs the diachronic perspective
**synchronic** considering differences from a non-temproal approch
**diachronic** cosidering from a temporal approach

### [Design features of human language] / Relevant dimensions for comparison of communication:
**Intentionality** --> behaviorial reprtoire or communication of thoughts
**Flexibility** --> can communication be applied outside very soecific context. (comm... be used for multiple communication instances)
**Expressivity** --> How rich is the communication system, (comm. can express something i depth)
#### **Structure** --> can signs be compined to express new meaning?
For more info, look at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockett%27s_design_features

Be careful exchanging Pavlov conditioning and cognition.
When thinking about animals behavior, and what you can denote from the behavior, be careful not to do it based on [anthropomorphism].

## **Conclusion** - the differences between human and animal communication
- Special physiology (vocal chords/larynx) 
- *Domain specific theories*: 
	-  An innate, genetically coded language module? 
	-  A hardwired ability to understand and use symbols? 
	-  How would that have come about in evolution? 
- *Domain general theories*: 
	- Language depends on general cognitive capacities (memory, attention, executive functions) 
	- And special social capacities: 
		- The ability to read intentions / mental states? 
		- Or a species-unique motivation to collaborate?


Monkeys are more likely to *not rely* on others humans/monkeys helping hints. If you tell a monkey to not take a treat, they wont understand/care. If you help them get the treat, they will take the help.
