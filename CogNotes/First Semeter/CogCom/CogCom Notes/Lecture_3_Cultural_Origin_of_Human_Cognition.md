# Cultural Origin of Human Cognition
## with focus of linguistic development

### Emergence of social cognition
**Social contingency** - namely contingent reactions of other to one's own actions.
2-month old infants recognizes and reacts more to live feedback, than replayed feedback. See page 10-12:
 ![[Lecture_3_ Language_acquisition.pdf]]

At age 9-12 months humans develop joint attention
Its unknown if humans are born with social cognition, but they develop expressive social interactive skills around this age.

We need to answer these questions to perhaps understand development of social cognition:
- Why do all of the joint attentional skills emerge together in correlated fashion? 
- Why is nine months the age at which this happens? 

A hypothesis is that newborns develop their [prototypical understanding] of "others are like me" or a "theory theory", and therefore begin to understand  others as [intentional agents] at nine months of age.

At around eight months of age, *Piaget‚Äôs infants* seemed to display a new understanding of action-outcome relations. 
The new behaviors that evidenced this new understanding were:
 (a)	 the use of multiple behavioral means to the same goal
 (b)	 the recognition and use of behavioral intermediaries in the pursuit of goals.


 
 ### Cultural learning
 It's also at 8 months humans begin imitating their human surroundings 
 
 When children develop expressive social interactive skills, they are able to learn through cultural learning. Cultural learning is learning from both cumulative culture to gain knowledge, and *culture* to learn how to interact with the cumulative culture.
 
**Cumulative culture:** ‚Äì
 Process of information (knowledge, technology, etc) accumulating over time, building on previous generations ‚Äì and resulting in cultural traits which would be impossible to obtain in an individual‚Äôs own lifetime 
**Culture:** -
 Group-typical behavior patterns shared by members of community that rely on socially learned and transmitted information
 
 
 
 
 
 
[CDS - Child Directed Speech]
- Shorter utterances
	- Simplified word representation for scaffolding
- Higher and wider pitch
	- More differentiation leads to faster learning
- Slower
	- Statistical mechanisms of infants and word delineation
- Simplified
	- Grammar and vocabulary
- Repeated
	- Situational 



Research: 
- What is the difference between prototypical and Neonatal?
Neoantal is newborn (humans/mammals)
Prototypical is the first version of communication or other things.



**Conversation** between to infants without words, contained following traits (estimated for 12-15ish months) 
Alignment Gesture
Rhythm
Turn-taking
Prosody (prosodies) (tonality of sentence)
Adjacency pair
Joint attention
Imitation


### Human learning compared to other mammals
In opposition to monkeys, children blindly follow guides (help from authority). Even though children don't understand the causality, the are very inclined to imitate.

**Emulation learning** - subjects learn about parts of their environment and use this to achieve their own goals
**Imitation learning** - Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task

#### Dyadic- and Triadic interactions
 
 Dyadic interaction (6 months)
 - The infant
 - The adult
‚ÄúTriadic‚Äù interaction (ca, 9 months)
- The infant 
- The adult 
- An object or element of shared attention


#### Development of interpersonal attention
![[The Joint Attentional Scene.png]]


Children reacts strongly to *ostensive* (attention grabbing) expressions / prosody.
And probes the child to  *learn about the world*, instead of having normal interactions with caretaker.

Phonemes = Sounds
Morphemes = Speech / Smallest units of meaning
Words = Sign with meaning
