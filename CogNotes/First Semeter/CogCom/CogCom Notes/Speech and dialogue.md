## Psycholinguistics
Most of language studies has been in psycholinguistic studies.



## Speech processing
### The Garrett Model
#ü•ÄMissing  see lecture 5 PP


### The "cascading" model (cutting & ferreira, 1999)
[Concept]: An idea of an object (fx a **tiger**)
[Lemmas]: the words we think of when we see/think of a **TIGER** - Jaguar - Leopard: we pick the word that is most alike
[Sounds]: we then decide how to pronounce that word, with the most likely word most likely to be pronounced --> **TIGER** - trigger - Jaguar - Jagged - etc




### Monologue vs Dialog as speech
For most of linguistics lifetime monologues have been the main focus of studies:
Explained by  **Linell (2005),** that written monologue is the current "the model" for linguistics/language sciences:
Therefore be critical of models of models describing speech as a monologue.

## Dialogue: The most natural and basic form of language use?
Most of human speech is through dialogue, we learn language through dialogue and mostly speak using dialog.

Dialog is often based on adjacency pairs:

person A produces a question and expects person B to answer in a particular way.

| Person A       | Person B             |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Hey            | (hey back)           |
| How you doing? | Answer regarding day |


 
### Dialog is based of common ground:
**Grounding in Communication (Clark and Brennan, 1991)**:
The active sharing of knowledge, beliefs and assumptions.

Related to  [[Theory of Mind]]: The ability to proximate mental states of oneself and others.

#### Backchannels
In dialogue, interlocutors (speakers in the dialog)  give each other feedback and "evidence" for understanding ("aha", "mm", "ok" etc)

If the listener is unattentive, (doesn't provide backchannels), the speaker speaks less fluently, make false stats, avoid details etc.

#### Repairs
The interlocutors provide ‚Äúrepairs‚Äù in response to missing or negative feedback, fx "huh", "what" or repeating a part of the sentence.

### [[Recipient design]]
People adapt their dialogue based on the recipient of the information. we therefore change our tonality, difficulty of information and words.

"**Conceptual pacts**" a flexible and temporary agreement between interlocutors, to change their common ground.



### Priming
The mechanism of alignment: automatic priming.

"processing of a target stimulus is aided/facilitated or altered by the presentation of a previously presented stimulus"
 
 The targets response is altered by a stimuli 


### Alignment
Alignment is the synchronization of speech, body movement, stance etc.
The better we are aligned to someone, the better their impression of us will be on average.
Better alignment, (and priming of each other), gives better effects in teamwork.
