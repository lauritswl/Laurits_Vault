## Tomasellos first steps of language
Tomasello argue first steps towards a usage-based theory of language acquisition:
1)  The primary psycholinguistic unit of child language acquisition is the *utterance*, which has as its *foundation* the expression and understanding of *communicative intentions*
2)  Early in their language development children are attempting to reproduce* not adults words* but *whole adult utterances*.
3)   Children's earliest utterances are almost totally concrete in the sense that the are instantiations (make up alternatives) of item-based schemas or constructions.
4)   Abstractions result from children generalizing across the type variation they observe at particular "slots" in otherwise recurrent tokens of the same utterance.
5)   Children create novel utterances for themselves via usage-based syntactic  operations in which they begin with an utterance-level schema and then modify that schema for the exigencies of the particular communicative situation (usage event) at hand.

## Focus on concrete language
In this paper Tomasello focuses on the concrete use of language in children, rather than theoretical language accusation.

Children develop their early communication, like they do triadic/joint attention. By mirroring adults, and receiving feedback.

When a child only succeeds at mirroring (reproducing) a single linguistic element, its called a **holophrase**.

Recent studies suggest that young children's early language consists of item-based structures with highly constrained slots - eg. "i want x" or "mommy x-ing that".

#### Verb-island constructions
Children's early grammar can be characterized as an inventory of utterance schemes resolving around verbs (verb-island construction).
This means that children develop their syntax around the verbs - i.g "hitter" -> "thing hit" -> "thing hit with".
TLDR: Children learn syntax by trial and error around verb-based sentence constructions.
First at age 4.5 children begin to use the verb in abstract syntax.
The more children hear a certain version (b√∏jning) of a verb, the more *entrenched* it becomes in the vocabulary.

See [[Noam Chomsky opposed to Michael Tomasello]] to see how Noam Chomsky argues for children's universal grammar.

Its seems language accusation is plastically *very probed* to learn language early, but with that being said, this plasticity of language learning is only useful with usage-based training.

### A critical period of language accusation
Eric Lenneberg (1967) 
- There is a developmental window within which language has to mature (due to plasticity of the language module of the brain) 
- After this period it is very difficult/impossible to learn language
- Based primarily on anecdotal case studies (children deprived from linguistic stimulation)
### The "Usage-based" approach
- Language is learned from experience (through domain general learning mechanisms)
- Abstract linguistic knowledge/categories are ‚Äúextracted‚Äù from experience with language use
- Young children do generally not construe sentences they have not heard before, i.e. true productivity - develops late

Lieven et al. 1997: (children learn greatly from their environment)
	- Children 2‚Äì3 years of age use virtually all of their verbs in one and only one form and sentence context
	- 92% of the earliest multi-word utterances were related to one of their first 25 lexically based patterns
	- These were different for different children


Children rely on statistical learning, when they have to learn when words are separated.
That means they learn by hearing which word-endings often are followed by certain word-beginnings.

## Fast Mapping
A inferential mechanism that supports word learning
The child uses the exclusion method, by knowing some words, and being introduced to a third word, that the child then quickly picks up.

["**fast mapping** is the term used for the hypothesized mental process whereby a new concept is learned (or a new hypothesis formed) based only on minimal exposure to a given unit of information"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_mapping)

It seems that children have a lot of innate cognitive abilities that lets them learn language early. There is on the other hand no evidence of children being born with an innate knowledge of syntax.

An example of childrens lacking knowledge is **The 'Tamming' experiment**

With all of the previously named studies, Tomasello claims that children aren't born with universal grammar (trying to denounce Chomsky). Because the only develop Linguistic productivity at the age of 4.

## Linguistic productivity
- Only quite late in development, infants start to abstract and generalize across constructions (linguistic productivity).
- Before the age of 4, children do rarely use verbs outside the specific constructions in which they have encountered them (i.e. productively).
- The infant rarely generalizes linguistic knowledge from one verb to another: the fact that they use the past tense form for one verb does not mean that they will use any other verb in the past tense.
