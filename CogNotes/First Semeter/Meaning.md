# Meaning
## What is meaning
When we try to communicate a *meaningful* sentence, we aren't sure the recipient of our language understands the sentence in the way we *meant*. 
If we try to talk about a *dog*, it can be all kind of breeds, a dog with a missing leg and so forth. We could in theory also talk about a [[Psychologically privileged level of categories|higher level of category fx mamal]], and still be correct.


But in reality as discussed in [[Knowledge]] it seems that [[Semantic Network|Semantic Networks are a better way of describing "meaning"]], as categories become more interlinked. This theory become even more nuanced, *and maybe to broad*, with the introduction of the [[Connectionist approach]]. 


[[Semantic paralexia]]
When a person (with deep dyslexia) makes a semantic paralexia, they pronounce a word as though it’s related in meaning to the one they’re trying to read. A few examples should make this clear.

Daughter is read as “sister”. 
Kill is read as “hate”. 
Rose is read as “flower”. 
Sergeant is read as “soldier”.


### [[Grounding]]
Our internal representations are grounded in our perceptions, actions, and feelings. [[The representation of concepts in the brain#The embodied approach|This is very similar to the embodied approach]]. Concepts have very direct links to the world, concepts and meaning aren’t just abstract, amodal things: thinking about real-world objects for example involves the visual perceptual system.

## *Understanding* meaning
The process of bringing two mental representations together so they share more than they did before the linguistic interchange is called alignment.

Temporary ambiguity (a sentence that can be understood in multiple ways) can by resolved by additional material:
```mermaid

TA([Temporary ambiguity])-->A[I saw the man with the binoculars]
A-->AM([Additional material])-->B[I saw the man with the binoculars that I had just picked up] & C[I saw the man with the binoculars use them to swat a fly]
```

### How do we deal with temporary ambiguity?
According to the ==**garden-path model**,== we pick the most likely structure on syntactic grounds, and carry on with it unless we’re forced to reanalyse by  new information. (uses two stages, the first using syntax, and a reconsideration using semantics)

According to the ==**constraint-based model**==, we use multiple sources of information to assign a structure The parser (listener) use multiple uses multiple sources of information, **called constraints**, to activate **alternative syntactic** structures in **parallel**.






#### Metaphor theory
We apply abstract things to simple metaphors, to understand the world in an "embodied" / "spatial" way.
