! Not everything is numbers (2nd person methods)
## Quantitative data 
**Numbers**:
Accuracy, Reaction times, Brain activity, Eye movements, Galvanic response, Heart rate, Ratings, Grades, etc....

This form for data is systematic, generalizeable, reliable - 
**very robust**

## Qualitative data
Capture human phenomenological experiences

**E.g. meaning in:**
- (complex) texts
- social interactions 
- non-verbal communication / gestures 
- emotional expressions 
- visual experiences
## Quantitative vs Qualitative data
Some aspects of human cognition are not directly quantifiable / do not come in numeric form.

We need an intermediate process of coding = categorizing qualitative phenomena in a format that can be analyzed numerically
- **Automated computer coding:**
	 for categories that are well defined / not overlapping (eg. text)
- **Manual human coding: **
	for phenomena that are more nuanced
