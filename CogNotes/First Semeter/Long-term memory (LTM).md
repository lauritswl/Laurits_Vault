#  Long-term memory (LTM)
Long-term memory doesn't need [[Short-term memory (STM)#^555d6f|Rehersal]] to store memory. LTM stores memories in a "hardware" sense, as opposed to STM's "software" memory, that need us to compute the memory repeatedly. LTM memory is an plastic change to the neuron structure. 
 
LTM is more of a archive, we can store items in, and pull out of.

### **The long term memory**

**Declaritive:**
 Memories we can talk about, and we have access to (conscious)
**Nondeclarative:**
Memories we cant access (unconscious)


## Division
**Episodic**:
"time travel in memories where you are present"
**Semantic:**
"Time travel where you aren't a part of it"
(Episodic memories repeated, may become de-experiencefied and thereby semantic)

**Procedural skills**:
"When you learn how to ride a bike, do addition or what fur feels like"
**Priming:**
"When you remember something quicker because something like that was mentioned"
**Conditioning:**
Classical conditioning:  neutral stimuli + stimuli that elicits a response --> neutral stimuli elicits response


Imagining is using past memories to
