# On inner voice
Inner speech is a form of self-regulation and self-monitoring
Inner speech = Children's monologue, but children just haven't learned to internalize it.
Not all children's monologue is an externalized inner speech, as they might just practice language or actually participate in dialog.
There is a difference between Vygotsky's and [[Thought#Is language development dependent on cognitive development|Pieget's]] view on what happens with children's monologue. As experimental support to Vygotsky's claims, (Behrend et al., 1992), When children are faced with problems, they produce guiding self-talk, and the harder the problem, the more self-talk.

## Vygotsky's language and cognition
Vygotsky saw a more complex relation between language and cognition.

Language = most sophisticated and complex system available for higher thought;
Infants have developed before language use.
when speech and cognition interact = most important moment of the child.
--> language moves on from purely social, to becoming a tool of abstraction and reason.

**Vygotsky's ideas are very plausible and intuitive, but have no research backing them**.
