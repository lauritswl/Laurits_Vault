lIs there a difference between  semantic placements of a linguistic word / opposed to its perceived version (picture).
Try to create your own Connectionist network.




**Ideas for NLP / Scraping**
Scraping of tweets across time for time relevant term to determine the word embeddings distance between over time.




**Online study:**
Noice results in top-down processing over bottom up processing.
Rational intergration of noisy evidence and prior semantic expectations in sentence interpretation

## Exam form
If you write together, you should mark who writes each section (fx initials).
Joint exam papers work really well, (3 is hard).
1 student 1-12 pages
2 students 17-22 pages 
(1 page = 2400 characters)

Topic = your choice (but subject of approval), should be about cognition *and* **communication**.
Should contain some element of empirical and quantitative data analysis 
- correlation, t-test, ANOVA/regression.
- Topic modelling
- Intercoder reliability


The exam isn't about sample sizes, mosly about design/analysis of the study.



**Collect consent when data is collected**, if you withhold information about the study you need to debrief afterwards


Interactions effekter - 
forståelse påvirkes af noise.
Det påvirkes forskelligt af en anden variable.
Så i stedet for at plusse predictore, så ganger vi dem.
Til at forstå: the map task, 4 billeder af situationen, hvilken passer bedst.


## What is a good topic?
What "real life" cognition and communication phenomenon we are dealing with?
Can it be formulated as a research question

#### What is measured?
Reaction time
Accuracy
MLU
Alignment
Sentiment
Semantic distance

**Tylen:**
What is manipulated (what is the predictor variable)?
Experimental conditions (or baseline)
2 by 2 factorial design







# Topics
## Animal communication
Differences in ape and human mother-child interaction
Hard topic as you need good videos.

## Language acquisition
Do parents accommodate their childre's language acqusition thought CDS (data at CHILDES)
Are there cross-cultural differences in CDS
- Analysis of different languages

Does alignment of vocabulary between mother and child predict vocabulary acqusition?
Do children with autism align less to their parents than neurotypical children.

Corss-cultureal differences in vocabulary acquisition [WordBank](http://wordbank.stanford.edu)
Are there any semantic differences in vocabulary across cultures?



## Dialogue
**Conceptual pacts**: E.g. the tangram task
Do people align in their use of gestures, e.g. interaction with an "actor"
Do people align emotianally using sentiment analysis
or in their speech rate (measures by Praat)




## Gesture
Does gesture facilitate understanding?
- Story comprehension or instructions without access to gestures or with incongruent gestures:
- Cab gestyre obstruct thinking? 
	- Cogwheel task

Gesytre and memory facilitation
- spatial description task

Do people gesture less when they cannot see eachother?

Do people gesture more when wearing facemasks - or when background noise is increased?


## Thought
Do linguistics categories have an effect on nonlinguistic categorization
Pitch experiment according to culture
Color experiment for language (Russian blues)
Do we have a bias towards stimuli presented to the visual field of our dominant hand?



## Meaning
Is language arbitrary
- How do we spontaneously map sound and meaning (Kiki - bouba)
- Other cross modality mapping

The architecture of our semantic memory - semantic distance / reaction time / priming



## NLP
Can word count methods or sentiment analysis be used to study changes in the attitude to sensitive topics over time?
Can word classification classify two genres of literary prose?
Can probabilistic topic modeling be used to explore prevalent topics in the commentatires to certain blogpost, newsfeeds etc.


## Communication Problems
How does different degrees of noise affect understanding of plausible and implausible passive constructions?
Noise experiments

Alignment in clinical populations
Communcation succes over video link, is it as effective to solve tasks over zoom, skype etc.
