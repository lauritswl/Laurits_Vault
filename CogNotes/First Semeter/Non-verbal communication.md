Gestrues with meaning independent of speech is called **emblems**. Emblems are culture dependent and can therefore be 'mispronounced'. 


## Sign Language
Emblems can be used in a system of gestures thus forming a sign language. But when* neurologically intact sign language users* see 'sign-language', they have *left hemisphere brain specialization*.  **However**, when they process non-meaningful movements/emblems such as waving good-bye / thumps up, there was no sign of cognitive asymmetry.
It seems that it is the coded nature of sign-language (and normal language) that triggers left hemisphere dominance.

## Speech accompanied gestures
McNeill's types of non-verbal speaking-gestures:
1) 'Iconic gestures' transparently captures semantic content of speech. For example, when describing pouring water the speaker will mirror the action with out the glass.
2) 'Metaphoric gestures' are like iconic gestures but with abstract rather than concrete content. For example, when someone is announcing they will present their idea, they could put out their arm, showing an abstract idea, as if it was in their hand.
3) 'Beat gestures' look as if they are beating musical time. The hand moves along with the rhythmic pulsation of speech.
4) 'Deictic or pointing gestures' indicate entities in the conversational space.

It's relatively easy to develop a gestural 'lexicon', see following experiment:

Same conversation descirbed by two transcribers, have about at 85-94% agreement rate of what the conversation is about, based of this study:

 | Video turned off / Only sound | Sound turned off / Only video                              |
 | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Describes whats being said    | Describes what they think is being said, based of of signs |
 
 >Reliability between two experimenters, each of whom transcribes the same videotape independently, is typically high for coding speech, gesture, and the relationship between the two (e.g. on conservation tasks, ==agreement between two coders ranges from 85% to 94%==)

### Gesture can reflect thoughts not conveyed in speech
Gesture permits the speaker to represent ideas that are compatible with its mimetic and analog format (e.g. shapes, sizes, spatial relationships).

These gestures also allow children to communicate prior to their first words (10 months). Children only use 'deitic' and 'iconic' gestures before speech production.  
Combining gesture and speech within a single utterance can also increase the communicative range available to children, fx pointing at an object and saying "mine".

#### Gesture mismatching
 
 Children can even show that they have a greater understanding of a problem/situation, than they can communicate through words, by showing correct detail in gestures, whilst communicating wrong details by speech. When gesture isn't the same as speech, it's a **gesture mismatch**. 

When children mismatch gestures, its an indicator that they aren't learning, what they are taught. It was observed that children went through these 3 steps, when getting a math-problem incorrect:
```ad-example
title: 3 steps of stability
1) a stable state in which the child produced gestureâ€“speech matches conveying incorrect procedures; 
2) an unstable state in which the child produced gestureâ€“speech mismatches; 
3) a stable state in which the child again produced gestureâ€“speech matches, now conveying correct procedures.
```

It turned out that children that went through stage 1-2-3, were better at generalizing the new knowledge, than children that went from 1-3.
==Mismatch is an index of variability==, and variability is considered by many theorists to be essential to developmental progress.

Gesturing while speaking helps the listener understand the point, as long as you don't mismatch your gestures, so they convey another point.

Gesturing also helps the speaker recall their point from memory. 
 As another example, gesturing while explaining a math task improves performance on a simultaneously performed word recall task. 
 Gesturing thus appears to increase resources available to the speaker, perhaps by shifting the burden from verbal to spatial memory. #ðŸ˜ŽCoolFact

title: Conclusion

When gesture is the **primary communication system** it takes on the **forms of language**, conveying meaning by systematic combinations of discrete units.
==However, when gesture is used spontaneously along with speech== it has the potential to display thoughts that are not conveyed in speech. 
These spontaneous gestures have **two**,* not mutually exclusive functions*:
 1) Gesture provides speakers with another representational format in addition to speech, which can reduce cognitive effort and serve as a tool for thinking. 
 2) Gesture also provides listeners with a second representational format, one that allows access to the unspoken thoughts of the speaker and thus enriches communication.

When we are derived off conventional vocal language, the best alternative is gestures.

For a matching gesture, the gesture should support/enhance the message verbally expressed. Else its a mismatched gesture. 

**Gesture classification:**

| Typological                     | Functional                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Preverbal**                     | **Emblems**                                 |
| Deictic (in conversation space) | Substitutes speech                         |
| Iconic (representational)       | Conventional, codified signs               |
| **Verbal**                        | **Spontaneous co-speech gesture**           |
| Metaphoric (relational)         | Enhancing and/or complementing information |
| - Beat gestures (rhythmic)      | Multimodaity                               |

title: Embodiment
**Traditional view**: Brain that uses algorithms to process information

**Emobdied view**:
- Information processing deeply contrained by body
- **Situated in cognition**: Natrual and social enviroment
- **Grounded** in the physical world

**Extended mind**: Panpsychism, the world as cognition --> discussion between two minds create a 3. interconnected mind
