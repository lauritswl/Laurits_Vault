# Critical Discourse Analysis
* The “Trinity”: 
	- Discourse-Historical Approach (Ruth Wodak) (tomorrow) 
	- Ideological Discourse Analysis (Teun Van Dijk) 
	- Fairclough’s approach (Norman Fairclough) (today)

**Critical:**
Examining ideology and being sceptical towards use of ideology/power
**Discourse:**
Any written, spoken or visual communication
**Analysis:**
Describing elements that structure the discourse

*Political engagement:*
CDA is positioned on the side of the oppressed groups and against the dominating groups.
**Discourse has ”ideological effects” on us:**
”[discourses] can help **produce and reproduce unequal power relations** between (for instance) social classes, women and men, and ethnic groups, **through the ways in which they represent things and position people**.” (Fairclough et al. p. 358)

### The three levels of discourse
**Discourse:**
1. Most abstract level: language use as social practice
2. The kind of language within a specific field/institution 
	* political discourse 
	* media discourse
	* university discourse
3. Most concrete sense: a way of speaking which gives meaning to experiences from a particular perspective (Jørgensen & Philips p. 67)

**Order of discourse**:  
The configuration of all the discourse types/genres which are used within a social institution

**The communicative event** = an instance of language use
Does the communicative event try to reproduce or transform existing social practices?

#### The three-dimensional model
