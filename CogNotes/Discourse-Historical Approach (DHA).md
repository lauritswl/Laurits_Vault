### DHA - Wodak
Discourse as **context related semiotic practice, socially constituted and constitutive**
- Populism as discursive **construction of us/them**:
	- Positivie self and negative other presentation realsied via **discursive strategies** 
- DHA focuses on how this is realised in **specific** genres (text, images etc.) and in a particular **historical context**
- Populist are embedded in a particular **historical context** and actively **use references to the past** to reproduce (new) systems of meaning (discourses) and **distinction between us/them**

### Laclau on populism:
Populism as political logic / a mode of articulation
Populism as **counter-hegemonic** project challenging established order

**Populism as articulation of equivalence and difference** through rhetoric-performative action re-producing an **antagonistic frontier (us/them)**.

Equivalence between **demands (that share their negativity)** while **differentation from an 'outside'** against which these demands are directed. 

**Empty signifier** as pars pro toto for universality of equivalently chain and thus **embodiment of mythical full-ness** and 'rallying point of passionate investments' (jouissance).


#### Populism as affective project
Populism as **counter-hegemonic** project challenging established order 
Populism as **articulation of equivalence and difference** through rhetoric-performative action, reproducing an antagonistic frontier.
Populism as taking place in a particular historical and socio-political context & populists make uses of the past.
Affect as **bodily-relational modes of being in the world** (how you feel) that **reproduce** social **orders** and borders.

==DHA analysis of populism==
**Populism** as counter-hegemonic project because it **challenges the "feeling rules**" that underpin the **established socio-political order**.
	- Affective Investments in Empty Signifiers
	- Feelings about us
	- Feelings about them
