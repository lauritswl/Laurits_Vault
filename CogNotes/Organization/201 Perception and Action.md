___
**Chapter 1**: Why perception and action?
## Do we need a strong central processer, such as the brain?
We have a brain to generate purposeful and complex movement. But the [[Embodied cognition]] approach emphasizes the role of the body and its capabilities. 
> Interacting with the world (finding food, avoiding danger, mating, ...) and communicating (speech, gestures, writing)

These actions doesn't necessarily need a complex brain, but just a nervous system that facilitates action.

**Historically**, focus on central cognitive processing: 
* **Perception** as the relevant “**input**” 
* **Action** has as the (uninteresting) **output**

Our interest in cognition “cannot just be about how the *brain absorbs information*. I**t must also be concerned with how the brain expresses information**”

### Biomechanical constraints
Biomechanical constraints are **both limitations on movement & reduction of complexity for planning and performing action**.
These limitations can therefore reduce complexity of actions, and therefore make us quicker to take action.

**The degrees-of-freedom problem:**
> "*if we consider the 600 or so muscles in the human body as being, for extreme simplicity, either contracted or relaxed. This leads to 2600 possible motor activations, more than the number of atoms in the universe*" - Wolpert & Ghahramani, 2000

How to select one combination of intrinsic coordinates from so many possibilities (underdetermined problem)?

* **Compute the optimal movement** (But what is optimal)
	* Motor system uses cost functions to calculate what the best possible movement is
	  (motor control becomes cost minimization)
* **Rely on automatic movements** (But these do not give flexibility!)
* **Plan on movement sequences step by step** (But that can lead to detours and dead ends)

___
**Chapter 2:** Principles of multisensory integration

Natural objects and events are usually multisensory. Nausea experienced in virtual reality simulators suggest that the brain expects correlated signals to arrive.
When detecting stimuli multimodal activation helps in reaction time and detection of an object. This is hypothesised to be a result of *coactivation*.
"*Modality-specific responses to multimodal stimuli come together at polysensory brain areas. The combined response is stronger and more reliable than responses generated by unimodal stimuli, so RTs and detectability are both better.*"

### The effect of the multimodal stimulus on a cell’s response obeys three rules
***Spatial coincidence***: 
A **neuron** sensitive to both **visual and auditory** **stimuli** may have receptive fields in both modalities; visual stimuli must fall in a specific region of space, and auditory stimuli must emanate for a restricted range of directions. The two receptive fields usually overlap in space. 
**Multisensory response enhancement only occurs** when the respective **stimuli** fall **inside** the **area of overlap**. 

***Temporal coincidence***: 
Response enhancement only occurs when stimuli in different modalities arrive at about the same time.

***Inverse effectiveness***:
If a neuron responds very strongly to a unimodal stimulus, its response changes relatively little when another stimulus is added. But if the unimodal response is weak, there are stronger interactions with other stimuli.


**Crossmodal binding problem**:
The problem of the **perceptual system** deciding which signals to integrate and which not. When we observe an event, we need to decide which sensory inputs are responsible for observing that idea/object/thing.

### **Crossmodal correspondences**:
A compatibility effect between attributes or dimensions of a stimulus (i.e., an object or event) in different sensory modalities (be they redundant or not)

1) **Statistical**: pairs of stimulus dimensions that are correlated in nature, e.g. size and mass e.g. the natural correlation between the size, or mass, of an object and its resonant frequency 
2) **Structural**: due to neural connections that are present at birth
	    e.g. pairs of prothetic (i.e., magnitude-related) dimensions such as loudness and size […] given that magnitude (regardless of the particular dimension under consideration) appears to be represented in the same way by the brain 
3) **Semantic**: based on consistent language use
	    e.g. when the terms that people use to describe the stimuli in the two dimensions overlap, as for the words “low” and “high,” which are used to describe both the elevation of a visual stimulus and the pitch of a sound

___
**Chapter 3**: Experimental psychophysics

**psychophysics**:
**study of quantitative relations between psychological events and physical events** or, more specifically, between sensations and the stimuli that produce them.

## Signal Detection Theory (SDT)
1. **Response on sensory system**:
   Amount of response depends on stimulus intensity and sensitivity of the sensory system
2. **Decision process**:
   Depends on criterion how strong the sensory response needs to be counted

## Psychophysical analysis
*Techniques to study links between **perception** (= subjective mental events) and **physical stimulation** (= sensory events)*

1. **Method of limits**:
   **Example**: Intensity of a light in a dark box is gradually increased, report when light becomes visible
2. **Method of adjustment**:
   **Example**: Turn dial and adjust light until it is just visible, or until it is just noticeably brighter than before 
3. **Method of constant stimuli**:
   **Example**: Light is repeatedly presented at several intensities, indicate when it is visible or invisible

**Chapter 5**: NEUROBIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
*How (and where) the brain processes action*
# NEUROBIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
## The brain areas of action processing
Execution of actions require an intact functional loop:
the **frontal cortex** , the **premotor and motor cortices** , the **basal ganglia** , and the **cerebellum**

#### Distinctions: 
*Movement vs Action*
**Movement**: Muscle activations, can be involuntary
**Action**: Goal-directed, partially under voluntary control

*Distal- vs Proximal goals*
**Distal goals:**
The changes in the environment we expect or desire, e.g. holding the glass in your hand 
**Proximal goals:**
The steps required to fulfill the distal goals, e.g. specific muscles to be activated and movement paths to follow

### Action Specific Neurons
Much like [[906 Encyclopedia#For making mouseover definitions#Feature Specific Neurons|Feature Specific Neuron]] follows the **principle of distributed coding** of features, *distributed coding* is also present in **various features of action**. It has been shown
in *monkeys*, for example, that the **direction, expenditure of energy, and range of a
movement** are *coded in a distributed manner*.
As seen in [[#Monkeys eating cortex]] these neurons are not responsible for a single muscle, but rather a movement.


**Overview of motor specific areas:**
![[Action Specific Cortexes.png]]
**Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** is *responsible* for action goal representation and activation, implementation, and configuration of executive control.


### Monkeys eating cortex:
```ad-info
title: Monkeys 'Eating' Cortex
Graziano et al. ( 2002 ) electrically stimulated various areas within the primary motor and premotor cortex of two monkeys. Unlike the classical studies by Penfield, in which stimulation of short durations was used (ca. 50 ms), these authors stimulated the neurons of the motor cortex for 500 ms. 
Instead of *contractions of single muscles*, **they evoked fluent, spatially and temporally well-coordinated movements** that were directed at **spatial goals** under these conditions. The *stimulation of a specific area*, for example, led the monkey to close its finger, move its hand to its head, and then open its mouth. This movement sequence occurred reliably, **independent of the hand’s position when stimulation was commenced**.

### Primary motor cortex (M1)
*Main function*: controlling execution of motor commands from other areas

### Premotor Cortex (PM)
```ad-cite
title: Wikipedia citation of Premotor Cortex (PM)
The **premotor cortex** is an area of the [motor cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex "Motor cortex") lying within the [frontal lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe "Frontal lobe") of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain") just anterior to the [primary motor cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_motor_cortex "Primary motor cortex"). It occupies part of Brodmann's area 6. It has been studied mainly in primates, including monkeys and humans.
...
It *may also play a role* in **planning movement, in the spatial guidance of movement, in the sensory guidance of movement, in understanding the actions of others, and in using abstract rules to perform specific tasks.**

```

### Supplementary Motor Area (SMA - BA6 Medial)
The *SMA is* the medial part of the premotor cortex and is *important* for the **selection,
planning, and sequencing** of *goal-directed actions*.
**Tanji and Shima ( 1994 )** were able to demonstrate the existence of **different types
of neurons** in the *SMA of monkeys*:
- Neurons that fired during the **preparation of a movement sequence**
- Neurons that were only active in the interval **between two movements**
- Neurons that appeared to represent the succession of single movements

SMA is also involved significantly with the **encoding of intentions** and **action goals** and the **selection of intentional actions**.
