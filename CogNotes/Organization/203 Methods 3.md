#### Machine learning:
**Multilevel modeling and generalizability of patterns**
The machine learning approach: *classification problems*
We start by understanding the *logistic regression*, due to its simplicity. Logistic regression is easily replaced with whatever.

Bayesian multilevel modelling is an attempt at inferring more generalizable patterns
- Combining information across clusters (e.g. participants) to "correct" the noisy raw data within participant.


#### Neural Networks
Multiple layers of **non-linear** processing
Many psychiatric conditions alter the voice, voice recoding is cheap and non-invasive.
