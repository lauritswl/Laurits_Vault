Science is a huge *network* of scientific  articles/groups.
The effectiveness of information flow across sources depends on the *information flows in the network*.
e.g. a network where every node is connected **vs** a network where a node is only connected to the n closest nodes.

Networks differ in the degree of connections between nodes.
