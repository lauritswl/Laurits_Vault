## Signs as described by Saussure and Barthes
This short discussion will regard the *sign*. The goal is to introduce and explain the origins of the sign in the Saussurean tradition of semiotics and describe its relation to Roland Barthes sign and myth theory. 

Ferdinand de Saussure studied linguistics in a revolutionary way in comparison to his temporaries. His most famous and influential work is his 1916 posthumous *Cours de linguistique générale*. This collection of notes from his lectures induces a shift of the linguistic paradigm. The linguists adapts to Saussure's methodology of analysing language as a formal system of elements instead of analysing the messy dialectics of real time communication. 
Saussure focuses on the structure of the relationship between **signs** and the language system, and is therefore regarded as the father of linguistic structuralism
