# Reaction time and mouse tracking
## Reaction time
**Reaction times** indicates about how **long a task takes**, *and,* using clever designs, how a **manipulation affects cognitive processing**, *but,* not how long a **decision-making process unfolds**.
#### Introduction of eye/mouse tracking
*Shows the "story"* behind behavioural responses, but its a *effortful setup* that is **restricted to particular tasks and modalities**.

**Major advanteges:**
Applicable to all kinds of cognitive science research 
Fine-grained measure of decision microstructure, capturing inbetween states 
Neurophysiological support for hand movements as valid index of evolving decisions 
High temporal resolution (depending on devices) 
Freely available and easy to use: standard computer + mouse ยง Freeware (for both running and analyzing)
