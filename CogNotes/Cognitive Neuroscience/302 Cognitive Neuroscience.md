## Fundamental Principles of the brain
When a  [[Neuron]] fires it reaches its [[Action Potential]]. The [[Action Potential]] flows down the axon, and activates the synaptic neurotransmitter release, and begin the [[synaptic transmission]]. 
If multiple [[synaptic transmission|synaptic transmissions]]  interact with the same post-synaptic neuron, this is called [[synaptic integration]] 



### [[neurotransmitter]]
There are in general two different types of neurotransmitters - 
Inhibitory and excitatory

[[Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)]]



# Vision
What are the problems to be solved?
Nothing but electromagnetic energy (light rays) if different wavelengths and amplitudes --> as a result of light rays interacting with the environment, but we still see colour, shapes and movement .

We have two eyes, that see two different combinations of lights rays, but we still merge the two visual modalities into one perception..



Voltage- and transmitter gated channels.

## Hearing
The first stages of the basic auditory pathway look like this:
Sound wave moves the tympanic membrane. →
  Tympanic membrane moves the ossicles. →
    Ossicles move the membrane at the oval window. →
	  Motion at the oval window moves fluid in the cochlea. →
		Movement of fluid in the cochlea causes a response in sensory neurons.
