## Fundamental Principles of the brain
When a  [[Neuron]] fires it reaches its [[Action Potential]]. The [[Action Potential]] flows down the axon, and activates the synaptic neurotransmitter release, and begin the [[synaptic transmission]]. 
If multiple [[synaptic transmission|synaptic transmissions]]  interact with the same post-synaptic neuron, this is called [[synaptic integration]] 



### [[neurotransmitter]]
There are in general two different types of neurotransmitters - 
Inhibitory and excitatory
