## Fundamental Principles of the brain
When a  [[Neuron]] fires it reaches its [[Action Potential]]. The [[Action Potential]] flows down the axon, and activates the synaptic neurotransmitter release, and begin the [[synaptic transmission]]. 
If multiple [[synaptic transmission|synaptic transmissions]]  interact with the same post-synaptic neuron, this is called [[synaptic integration]] 



### [[neurotransmitter]]
There are in general two different types of neurotransmitters - 
Inhibitory and excitatory

[[Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)]]



# Vision
What are the problems to be solved?
Nothing but electromagnetic energy (light rays) if different wavelengths and amplitudes --> as a result of light rays interacting with the environment, but we still see colour, shapes and movement .

We have two eyes, that see two different combinations of lights rays, but we still merge the two visual modalities into one perception..



Voltage- and transmitter gated channels.

## Hearing (Audition)




The first stages of the basic auditory pathway look like this:
Sound wave moves the tympanic membrane. →
  Tympanic membrane moves the ossicles. →
    Ossicles move the membrane at the oval window. →
	  Motion at the oval window moves fluid in the cochlea. →
		Movement of fluid in the cochlea causes a response in sensory neurons.



# Emotion
#### James-Lange Theory
We experience emotions *in* response to physiological changes in our body. That is, we begin to cry and feel sad as a causal emotional reaction.  
	the problem with this theory is that it implies that we can only feel feelings that are expressed in our physiological domain.
#### Cannon-Bard Theory
Emotions can occur independently from physiological responses. 
	In this paradigm the Thalamus is central for affective experience.  This is also the problem of this thinking, even though the thalamus is important for emotion, it is not solely responsible.

 ## Papez circuit
 The Papez circuit is a brain circuit involved in emotional processing and regulation. It is composed of interconnected brain regions that work together to integrate information related to emotional experiences and bodily responses.

When we experience a stimulus, such as seeing a scary movie, the information is processed by the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation. From there, the information is sent to the cingulate gyrus, which regulates emotional responses and behaviors.

The cingulate gyrus then sends the information to the anterior thalamic nuclei, which is involved in processing and relaying information between different brain regions. This information is then sent to the hypothalamus, which plays a role in regulating autonomic functions such as heart rate and blood pressure.

Finally, the information is sent back to the hippocampus, completing the circuit. This loop-like circuit allows for the integration of emotional experiences, memory, and bodily responses, resulting in the experience of emotions and the appropriate bodily responses.

Dysfunction of the Papez circuit has been associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders.


# Movement
Movement muscles 
## Excitation
1. An action potential occurs in an alpha motor neuron axon.
2. ACh is released by the axon terminal of the alpha motor neuron at the
neuromuscular junction.
3. Nicotinic receptor channels in the sarcolemma open, and the postsynaptic
sarcolemma depolarizes (EPSP).
4. Voltage-gated sodium channels in the sarcolemma open and an action
potential is generated in the muscle fiber, which sweeps down the sarcolemma
and into the T tubules.
5. Depolarization of the T tubules causes $Ca^{2+}$ release from the SR.

## Contraction
1. $Ca^{2+}$ binds to troponin.
2. Tropomyosin shifts position and myosin binding sites on actin are exposed.
3. Myosin heads bind actin.
4. Myosin heads pivot.
5. An ATP binds to each myosin head and it disengages from actin.
6. The cycle continues as long as $Ca^{2+}$ and ATP are present.

## Relaxation
1. As EPSPs end, the sarcolemma and T tubules return to their resting
potentials.
2. $Ca^{2+}$ is sequestered by the SR by an ATP-driven pump.
3. Myosin binding sites on actin are covered by tropomyosin.
