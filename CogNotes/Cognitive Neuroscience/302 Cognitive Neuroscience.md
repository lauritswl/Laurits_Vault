## Fundamental Principles of the brain
When a  [[Neuron]] fires it reaches its [[Action Potential]]. The [[Action Potential]] flows down the axon, and activates the synaptic neurotransmitter release, and begin the [[synaptic transmission]]. 
If multiple [[synaptic transmission|synaptic transmissions]]  interact with the same post-synaptic neuron, this is called [[synaptic integration]] 



### [[neurotransmitter]]
There are in general two different types of neurotransmitters - 
Inhibitory and excitatory

[[Central Nervous System (CNS)]]
[[Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)]]



# Vision
What are the problems to be solved?
Nothing but electromagnetic energy (light rays) if different wavelengths and amplitudes --> as a result of light rays interacting with the environment, but we still see colour, shapes and movement .

We have two eyes, that see two different combinations of lights rays, but we still merge the two visual modalities into one perception..



Voltage- and transmitter gated channels.

## Hearing (Audition)




The first stages of the basic auditory pathway look like this:
Sound wave moves the tympanic membrane. →
  Tympanic membrane moves the ossicles. →
    Ossicles move the membrane at the oval window. →
	  Motion at the oval window moves fluid in the cochlea. →
		Movement of fluid in the cochlea causes a response in sensory neurons.




# Movement
Movement muscles 
## Excitation
1. An action potential occurs in an alpha motor neuron axon.
2. ACh is released by the axon terminal of the alpha motor neuron at the
neuromuscular junction.
3. Nicotinic receptor channels in the sarcolemma open, and the postsynaptic
sarcolemma depolarizes (EPSP).
4. Voltage-gated sodium channels in the sarcolemma open and an action
potential is generated in the muscle fiber, which sweeps down the sarcolemma
and into the T tubules.
5. Depolarization of the T tubules causes $Ca^{2+}$ release from the SR.

## Contraction
1. $Ca^{2+}$ binds to troponin.
2. Tropomyosin shifts position and myosin binding sites on actin are exposed.
3. Myosin heads bind actin.
4. Myosin heads pivot.
5. An ATP binds to each myosin head and it disengages from actin.
6. The cycle continues as long as $Ca^{2+}$ and ATP are present.

## Relaxation
1. As EPSPs end, the sarcolemma and T tubules return to their resting
potentials.
2. $Ca^{2+}$ is sequestered by the SR by an ATP-driven pump.
3. Myosin binding sites on actin are covered by tropomyosin.
