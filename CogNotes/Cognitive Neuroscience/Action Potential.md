When we have a incoming signal to the neuron, that is strong enough to depolarise the membrane, the sodium channels will open. Sodium-ions (Na+) will flow into the cell.  The protentional difference across the membrane (mV) will rise quickly, and begin a chain reaction of gates opening down the axon.

Imagine that a neuron is like a water balloon that is waiting to be popped. When the neuron receives a strong enough signal, it's like someone popping the balloon. This causes the neuron's membrane to become depolarized, which means that the charge inside the neuron becomes more positive than the charge outside.

This depolarization triggers the opening of sodium channels, which allow positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron. As more and more sodium ions enter the neuron, the potential difference (measured in millivolts) across the neuron's membrane rapidly increases. This sudden surge in potential difference creates a chain reaction of gates opening down the neuron's axon, like a row of dominoes falling over.

This chain reaction, called an action potential, allows the electrical signal to travel down the length of the neuron and eventually reach other neurons or muscle cells, which helps us move, think, and feel.

Potassium ions (K+) also play an important role in the action potential of a neuron. After the influx of sodium ions depolarizes the neuron's membrane, the sodium channels start to close and the potassium channels start to open. This allows positively charged potassium ions to flow out of the neuron, which helps restore the negative charge inside the neuron and brings the membrane potential back to its resting state.

As the potassium ions flow out, the potential difference across the membrane starts to decrease, eventually becoming even more negative than the resting potential. This brief period of hyperpolarization actually makes it more difficult for the neuron to fire another action potential immediately after the first one, which is important for controlling the timing and frequency of neuronal firing.

In summary, the flow of potassium ions out of the neuron helps repolarize the membrane and return the neuron to its resting state, which is critical for the proper functioning of the nervous system.
