## Participants
Participants Sixteen participants (11 women and 5 men) aged between 18 and 27 years (M = 20.1 years, SD = 2.4 years) were paid £15 to contribute data to this study. All participants were undergraduate students at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. They all reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and were right-handers as measured by the Edinburgh Inventory.

## Materials
2.2. Stimuli and apparatus

**Description of faces used and screen resultion etc**
Photographs of eight female celebrities were used in the experiment. The celebrities had been selected on the basis of high familiarity ratings in an earlier study. For each celebrity, two different exemplars were used, one version for the familiarization phase and one for the test phase. This was done to prevent purely picture-based familiarity effects. Additionally, the faces of two celebrities (Penelope Cruz [actress] and Britney Spears [singer]) were used for practice trials. Faces were obtained from different sources but were all software-edited using Adobe Photoshopi. They were converted to grayscale and each face was framed within an area 180 pixels wide X 220 pixels high, corresponding to 5.8  X  7.1 cm on the screen.  Using ERTSi (Experimental Run Time System, Berisoft), the stimuli were presented in a dimmed room at a distance of about 85 cm at a screen resolution of 800 X 600 pixels.


**Photo manipulation:**
All pictures were further manipulated in two ways. First, we used the unmanipulated faces (Original) to produce Thatcherized faces (Thatcher) by turning the areas of the eyes and the mouth by 180. 
The resulting edges of these areas were smoothed to remove graphical inconsistencies or artificial local saliencies in the pictures. Second, in addition to the upright versions (upright), all faces were also rotated clockwise by 90 (ninety) and by 180 (inverted).
In total, there were 8 (celebrities)  X 2 (class: Thatcher vs. Original)  X 3 (orientation: up, ninety, inv) = 48 different test face versions, and 2 X 2 X 3 = 12 different practice face versions.

## Procedure
**Making sure participants were familiar with the faces:**
Before the experiment started, participants performed a verbal identification decision task on all celebrities presented in the study to ensure familiarity. To this means, we presented typical non-manipulated pictures, which were different to those used in the experiment. As a participation criterion, participants had to identify at least 8 of 10 faces. The experiment consisted of a practice phase using the two practice faces and a test phase using pictures of eight different celebrities.

**Trial Description**
Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross in the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then, a question about the identity of a succeeding face was presented for 500 ms (e.g., ‘‘Is this Julia Roberts_?’’) followed by a second fixation cross visible for 1000 ms. Text was presented in white on a black background and all names were derived from the celebrities included in the face set. After that, the picture of a celebrity was presented either for 34 ms (short presentation time, PT) or 200 ms (long PT) and participants judged whether the face matched the previously presented name by pressing one of two response buttons.

**Describing considerations like noise-masking and time-intervals**
For face-name matches, the same button had to be pressed irrespective of orientation or Thatcherization. For non-matches, the ‘‘different’’ button had to be pressed. Index fingers of both hands were used for responding. Both speed and accuracy were stressed. The face stimulus was masked by a random dot pattern for 366 ms or 200 ms for the short and long presentation time, respectively. Note that these different mask durations provided the same offset of visual stimulation for both target presentation times at 400 ms after face stimulus onset. The interval between maskoffset and the onset of the next trial was 2000 ms. The time course of a trial is illustrated in Fig. 2.

**Describing Cap position:**
The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded with sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes mounted in an electrode cap (Easy-Capi) at the scalp positions Fz, Cz, Pz, Iz, Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, FT9, FT10, P9, P10, PO9, PO10, F9,VF10, V TP9 and TP10.
