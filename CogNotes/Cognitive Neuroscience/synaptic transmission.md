Synaptic transmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other in the nervous system.

Neurotransmitter release begins when an action potential reaches the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron. This causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open, allowing calcium ions to flow into the axon terminal. The influx of calcium ions triggers the fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, which releases the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the small gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.

The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, which can either excite or inhibit its activity. If the neurotransmitter is excitatory, it can cause depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron, making it more likely to fire an action potential. If the neurotransmitter is inhibitory, it can cause hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron, making it less likely to fire an action potential.

After the neurotransmitter has done its job, it can be removed from the synaptic cleft in a variety of ways. One common method is through reuptake, where the presynaptic neuron takes up the neurotransmitter using transporters and recycles it for future use. Alternatively, the neurotransmitter can be broken down by enzymes or simply diffuse away from the synaptic cleft.
