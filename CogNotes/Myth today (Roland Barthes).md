**REFLECTION QUESTIONS**

Text: _Myth today_ in Roland Barthes (1957) _Mythologies_. Pages 131 - 156

**Question 1:**

”Myth is a second-order semiological system” Barthes writes p. 137, and then goes on to present the superposition of myth and language (table, p. 138, top). According to Barthes, myth is a _metalanguage_: it is a ”second language” in which one speaks about the ”first language”. Barthes illustrates this point with two examples: the grammar-example and the _Paris-Match_ example. Choose one of these examples and explain – in your own wording - how we can understand myth as a meta-language in this specific example.


**Grammar example:**
When the student opens his textbook for his latin class, he is presented with a lot of words, signifiers, and understand what their meaning, signified. This combination creates a sign of language for the student. But the student realises its not the sentences meaning, sign, that is its purpose. The student therefore resorts to his meta-language, second language, where the sign of the sentence now is the signifier. The signified for the student is what the sentence means in the context, "i am a grammatical correct sentence". A new sign in metalanguage then emerges for the student, where both the fact that its a grammatical sentence and the meaning of the sentence becomes a global sign. 


**Question 2:**

Page 140 (top), Barthes makes a point on his choice of terminology. Barthes distinguishes two ”planes”: the plane of language and the plane of myth. This table is also reproduced in the Graphics guide on Semiology page 51 accompagnied by the following explanation.

Mark with an ”X” in the table below, the plane which the listed concepts applies to and note the number from the table above (1-6) corresponding to the place in the model where the concept fits.

**Question 3:**

Page 148 Barthes summarizes the relation between the plane of language and the plane of myth:

_We now know that myth is a type of speech defined by its intention (I am a grammatical example) much more than by its literal sense (my name is lion); and that in spite of this, its intention is somehow frozen, purified, eternalized, made absent by this literal sense.

Because myth is intentional, it subjects the individual to its force, which Barthes later (page 149) explain by the analogue of an arrest. How does myth ”arrest” Barthes when he sees a basque chalet in the middle of Paris?


**Not quite sure?**
Barthes is at the intrigued by the basque chalet and the myth of its history and visuals. But he then remembers that this is a myth, and sees the basque for what it is. Only hears the sentence "my name is lion", and is arrested in his understanding. the chalet he sees has been stolen, and given to him in a mythical sense, where he can see the basque, but not see the basque in its real nature. 

 He freezes as he is confronted with the distorting effects of discourse. The architects idea of the basque is removed, as he feels the building is created just for him. 


**Question 4:**

In the section _Reading and decephering myth_ Barthes discusses the reception of myth which he phrases ”is speech justified _in excess_” (p. 154) and that it is ”frozen into something natural” (p. 154). How can it be that myth naturalizes meaning? (see also Graphics guide, Introducing Roland Barthes)

For Barnes the natural is a concept misunderstood in society (christianity, marriage etc. is natrual), as it should only be eating, drinking etc that is natrual.
When you introduce myth, the full signifier becomes intertwined with its mythical signified, and it becomes unveiled. Its this mythical signified (meaning) that becomes natural as the myth enacts as a discourse/ideology, that normalizes the full signifiers meaning as the mythical signified.
