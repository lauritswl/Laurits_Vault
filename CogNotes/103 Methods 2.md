## Overview

This course is about regression modelling and its conceptual and mathematical foundations. The main emphasis is on *linear* regression and the *general linear model* (GLM). 


## Literature

The main textbook for this course is [[Methods ROS.pdf|Regression and Other Stories by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020)]]
The secondary textbook [[Essential_Mathematics_for_Political_and_Social_Res.pdf|Gill - Essential Mathematics]]
