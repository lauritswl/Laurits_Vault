## Feature Specific Neurons
_Feature detectors_ are individual neurons—or groups of neurons—in the brain which code for perceptually significant stimuli. For example, simple cells in the visual cortex of the domestic cat, respond to edges—a feature which is more likely to occur in objects and organisms in the environment.
