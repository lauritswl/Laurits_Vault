# Marxism
Contradiction between classes
Proletariat vs Bourgeoisie - Working vs Ruling class

**Dialectical materialism**
Two realities synthesize into a common dialectic reality, that drives progress towards a common materialism.

# Ideology and discourse
**Hegemony** = a relation of dominance which appears as both natural and legitimate to all involved

The aim of the new left is to rethink the "old" left.

Whats new about the new left?
1) Althusser brings psychanalysis and the works of Jacques Lacan into his thinking of ideology.
2) According to Lacan, everything is mediated by language, and therefore language is important to take into account when analysing ideology.

**Althusser's works mark a paradigm shift in Marxism:**
From ideology as an economic class dommination (repression)
-> 
To ideology as both class domination AND a discursive domination ([[Discourse (Althusser)#^0abccd|RSA + ISA]]) (**subjectivation practices**)

*From state power to micro-power*


## The concept of ideology
**"Old" Marxism**: ideology is a mis-representation of the **real** conditions of the proletariat which **have to + can** be fought.
**Althusser:** Ideology is always there and **cannot** be fought. "The real" is always mediated and therefore dependant on language


**"Ideology has a material existence"**
Because ideology always manifests itself in action and practices

**"All ideology or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects"**:
Ideology constitutes individuals as subjects through discursive practices

**Individuals are always already subjects**



**The concept of interpellation**
* Articulates a relation between power (ideology) and language
* Proposes an analysis of some concrete discursive practices in which ideology manifests itself
* Brings in lacanian psychoanalysis into the theorization of power
* places in the centre of attention the **concept of identity**

Subjectivation is anchored economic power according to Althusser.
