##  Research Ethics
Research ethics are very important when collecting any kind of data, for studies or in business settings.

### Global research ethics
#### Why worry about research ethics?
Started by medical research going very wrong (e.g. Nazi-germany, The Tuskegee Syphilis Study)
Also in psychology: "Little Albert" is a case where James Whatson, a conditional psychologist, conditioned a baby for white fluffy things by behavioral conditioning. 
Stanford prison experiment - no long-term damage to participants, but very unethical research.

**These cases** are obviously unethical by how extremely they are unethical, we can take obvious examples, and apply it to less extreme cases.

#### Where do we get out ethical rules from?
We partly get our research ethics from intuition.

#### What do formal codes do?
**Social level**
Guide legislation
- Belmont report -> Code of Federal Regulation
	> ==**Belmont report**==
	> 1. *Respect for persons*: people are always ends in themselves
	-informed consent
	> 2. *Beneficence*: Knowledge justifies risk
	 -Minimise risk and maximize benefits
	> 3. *Justice*: The people who participate should gain (as a population)
	-Risk and benefits should be equally distributed

Autonomy (respect for persons) always trump the other ethical principals.
- Declaration of Helsinki -> Komitélov
	 

**Professional level**
- Regulate professional conduct
- Protect integrity of professions

**Individual level**
- Legal protection for participants and researchers
- Organize ethical intuitions
## (practical) Research Ethics  
Consent has to be:

**Informed**
The nature of the study, its potential risks and benefits, has to be disclosed to participants

**Specific**
Participants have to consent to the specific study.

**Consent has to withdrawable**
People have to know they participate so they can redraw consent

**Followed up with a debriefing**
If you don't have informed the participant of all parts of the study, they have to be debriefed and offered to withdraw their data.


### The special case of ethics in Denmark
==Researchers are always legally liable for un-ethical research==, GDPR-breach etc: So danish research doesn't have to receive the same top-down approval, but they have to be reliable.

#### Foundation: 
Declaration of Helsinki (same as belmont report) - **komiteloven**
**Basic principle**
- The interests of the individual always come before the interests of the scientific community
**Opreational principle**
Research much be based on knowledge.


5 main issues:
**Intervention**
**Privacy**
**Informed consent**
**Risk**
**Scientific value**

DoH/komiteloven only applies to biomedical research, which is very broadly defined:
Biomedical is defined by practice, not field. The definition not defined by invasivenes, but by **intervention**.
