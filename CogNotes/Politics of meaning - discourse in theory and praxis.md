### Portfolio feedback:
The first paragraph is so well written, i loved the blatant introduction of the signifier and signified, that is then later explained. Especially the arbitraity of the signifier is a good point, that i didn't think of including. 

The barthes section is easily segwayed into, but could it be improved by introducing the relation of signifier and signified in the plane of myth, perhaps instead of one of the examples pasta/london? 

I really liked the conclusion on barthes being on the level of parole in opposition to saussure being on the level of langue, but isn't Barthes both on the level of parole and langue, with his final output of myth being on the level of parole?


___ 
**My feedback**:

Goal of essay is good.
**Content**: quote is good, and first three paragraphs doesn't need change
4th paragraph, "Barth transformed the sign" (insert diagram)
Aditional text refrences (add page number)
Avoid repetions in the end, for conclusion.
