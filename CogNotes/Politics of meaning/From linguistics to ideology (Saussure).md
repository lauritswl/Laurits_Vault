**Questions for page 18-20**

1.    
Saussure starts by presenting the distinction between _language structure_ and _speech_, also known as _langue_ and _parole_ (which is the most common wording in discourse studies btw). Provide a short definition of these two concepts (see Saussure page 19 and Howarth page 18).

>a.      
Language structure (langue):  
(i + i + i + i) = I (general sentiment)

>b.     
Speech (parole):
("i" + "i" + "i" + "i" ...) = context specific
2.     How does Saussure understand the relation between these two concepts?  

3. 
Page 20, Saussure argues that real linguistics should concentrate on langue and not on parole. Why is that?
>
Parole is just the sum total of what people say, it resolves in no collective model.
Langue and parole can't be studied together, and we should therefore focus on langue, as that is the only subject that can be studied.

**Questions for page 65-70**

4. 
The linguistic sign consists of two composants: the signal and the signification, better known respectively as ”the signifier” and ”the signified”.

What caracterizes each of these composants? (see Saussure page 67+ Howarth page 19)

>a.      
The signal / the signifier:
Signifier = the phonetics / sign / image

>b. 
The signification / signified:
Signified (mental representation) - and everything it connects

5. 
Two principles applies to the study of signs (coined ”Semiology”) which also define two characteritics of the sign. The first is the arbitrary nature of the relation between signal and signification (aka signifier and signified), the second is the linary character of the signifier. What does it mean that this relation is ”arbitrary”?

>When you hear the word dog, you are not sure that the the speaker and reviver pictures the same dog. In that sentiment its a arbitrary relation.  


# Saussure (structuralism)
## Saussure's sign theory
**Who is Saussure and what is structuralism?**
Saussure is from Génève in 1857
Founder of the linguistic tradition structuralism

**Structuralism** understands language as a net or **a structure** where all elements are related to each other.
Language is a strucutre or a system = "LANGUE" (language structure)
Concrete use of language = "PAROLE" (speech)
Language consists of elements = "SIGNS" (elements)

**The three "dichotomies" of structuralism** (dichotomy = related in opposition)
	Langue vs Parole
| Langue                                    | Parole                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Theoretical concept                       | Concrete manifestation                              |
| Relation between each sign and the system | Relations between langue and concrete manifestation |
| ABSTRACT STRUCTURE                        | CONCRETE CASE                                                    |

	Synchrony vs Diachrohmy
| DIACHRONY                                     | SYNCHRONY                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| To study language in a historical perspective | To study language in relation to a concrete situation |
| The historical development of a language      | Language as a momentary manifestation                 |
| History of language / etymology               | How language appears at a concrete time               |
| E.g To trace the origin of a word             | E.g. What meaning a specific word has at a given time.                                                      |

	Syntagm vs Paradigm
| Symntagmatic relation                                               | Associative / Paradigmatic relation                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How the signs are related in the context of a phrase (syntagms)     | How the signs are related to other, similar signs in the language system     |
| The sign is understood in relation to the other signs in the phrase | The sign is understood in relation to other signs in the same system (other) |
| E.g. Polysemy: the same word can have different meanings            | E.g. Synonymy: (different signs, same meaning)                               | 


### Sign theory
A word, that is, a sign encompasses both a signal (signifier) and a signification (the signified)

**The signal/signifier:**
Signifier = The word (the acoustic image)


**The signification / the signified:**
signified = Mental representation (the concept)
 
 
**Referent:** 
The concrete thing, referred to by the sign,





# What is pragmatics
Is Utterances, Texts and Communication

**Pragmatics**: is interested in how some words have particular abilities / can perform an action in specific situations -> Parole

## Austin's concept of performativity
-> form structuralism from Pragmatics

In semantics, signification is understood in relation to how it describes things in the world outside language.
This way of studying signification is called **referentialism**.
-> the world is flat

J. L. Austin observes that some sentences encompasses words,, that **do not describe** the world, but do something in it.
-> I babtize this child
-> I bring cake on thursday

In these sentences we find a verb, which when uttered in the right circumstance, makes a change in the world.
**Performative**:
The performative words are generally characterized as follows:
* They are verbs
* Fist person singular
* Present tense
* If in doubt: check by adding "hereby" after the verb in the sentence
