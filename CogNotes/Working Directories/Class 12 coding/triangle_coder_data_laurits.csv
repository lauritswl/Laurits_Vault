sfmsk;video_1;;3;"The video was about two paper planes - a mother and a child. It seems they have a nice relationship where they dance together and the mother pays a lot of attention to the child. However, the mother also wants the child to leave the ""nest"" or the square around the paper planes. So the mother shows the child how to exit it and the child copies it nervously. However, outside the ""nest"" they ""celebrate"" and join tips and dance together again."
SD;video_1;;3;I saw it as a metaphor for someone (the smaller triangle) wanting to gain independence (step out into the world) but not really having the courage to do it without a little nudge (from the bigger triangle).
S;video_1;;3;To triangles move up and down and spins together (have a good time). The big triangle leaves the square (safe place), the small triangle shakes (nerveus). The big triangles helps the small triangle to get out of the square as well. The small triangle moves around outside (explore the unknown). They spin together in the end (have fun).
rss;video_1;;2;In the video the two triangles were fighting, like brothers or sisters, over who could get the other one out of the square and in the end the little blue one gave up, but the big red one still wanted to fight, so it ran after it.
Rønn;video_1;;3;The small triangle had a dance with the larger one. Then they had a disagreement, however they became friends again and left the containment box
qwerty;video_1;;2;The two triangles seemed to be playing some kind of game at first where one of their corners touched and they spun around. Then the big triangle went outside the box for a short duration of time. After the big triangle had returned it pushed the little triangle out of the box. After the small triangle had wandered around for a little while, the big triangle came out and they played the game from the begining again.
qw1952;video_1;;2;"initially like a triangle child pused out of the nest to ""learn how to fly"""
Queen;video_1;;2;The big red triangle was sort of transporting the little blue triangle and then in the end the big red triangle got rid of the little blue one
PSGslogLiverpool;video_1;;3;The big triangle wanted to learn the small triangle that outside the box, there was nothing to be afraid of. Probably a father-son relationship.
princess banana hammock;video_1;;3;the little triangle is the bigger ones child. The little triangle is very attached to it's mother but the mother is trying to get it outside the house (the square) first by trying to get it to follow and later by actually blocking it out
prik;video_1;;2;The triangles were playing, and then the big triangle pushed the little triangle outside to play.
Pretzel;video_1;;1;THere are two triangles inside a box. They spin around. The big triangle goes outside the box, while the small triangle stays inside. The big triangle enters the box again. The two triangles move around for a while. They both go outside the box and spin around.
pineconewithfeels;video_1;;3;With the risk of sounding like a complete moron, I think the two triangles fell in love, had a series of fights and finally acknowledges that they could never stay away from each other.
Patient HM;video_1;;3;The big triangle constitutes the mother while the small triangle constitutes the child. In the video, the mother and child are at first in a room where they play and are having a good time. The mother then tries to leave the room without the baby, but the baby gets scared. Then the mother encourages and nudges the baby out of the room. The baby resist initially but soon goes outside. The two seem happy in the end.
p230;video_1;;1;Two triangles in a box with one opening. A big red one and a small blue one. At one point they are joined and starts spinning. Later the big triangle pushes the small one out of the box and blocks the entrance. It then joins the small one and they start spinning again.
oma;video_1;;1;The red and the blue triangle start in the square. they move around each other and then attach themselves to each other and circle around. they detach and the red triangle move outside the square. it then pushes the blue triangle out of the square and block the entrance. then they attach again outside the square and circle around.
nulle;video_1;;3;"the small triangle was trapped inside the ""box"" and could only come out with help from the bigger triangle, they became friends"
Neo;video_1;;2;A parent/big triangle is bossing around with the small triangle. It is playful, though, and they sometimes break up their argument to start dancing and spinning in circles. The small triangle is not very obedient and teases the big triangle, pulling on it when it tries to leave the room and so on...
nemt;video_1;;1;Two triangles, a big and a small, were interacting. They were inside a non-closed square for the most of the time, but sometimes one, or both, would exit.
Nanna;video_1;;3;The little triangle was afraid to go outside the square, so the big triangle helped it
sfmsk;video_2;;3;The mother and child paper plane bounce on the walls outside the square. They're playing some game and enjoying themselves. Maybe the mother is teaching the child how to play. They keep bouncing back and forth kind of like that DVD screensaver logo, where it bounces from side to side and you want it to hit the corner but it never does. In the end they float out of the screen through the wall they were previously bouncing upon.
SD;video_2;;1;Two triangles bouncing from wall to wall sometimes being a bit closer to each other and sometimes distancing from each other. I was half expecting them to end up together in the square in the middle but that did not happen.
S;video_2;;1;The triangles move right and left. They bump into the walls (are constricted). At the end they move through the right side wall.
rss;video_2;;1;The two triangles were bouncing of the wall from one to another over and over again
Rønn;video_2;;1;The two triangles move parallel to each other horizontally. They moved at different speeds and had a square between them.
qwerty;video_2;;;So the two triangles were moving horizontally from one edge of the big box to the other, changing their orientation whenever they hit the wall. in the end of the video they went out of the screen even though it had seemed like the outer box was solid all through the video. The triangles movements seemed like some kinda reminded me of the bubbles on the pause screen of some computers.
qw1952;video_2;;;two pieces of cheese (after expiration date) are having a lovely road trip in a trunk of a food delivery truck, which's capacity was not fully taken advantage of, on a bumpy Wallonian highway.
Queen;video_2;;;The triangles tried to get inside the box but couldn't because when they hit the edge of the big box, it adjusted them to a different direction
PSGslogLiverpool;video_2;;;Just random triangles bouncing around and changing positions
princess banana hammock;video_2;;;The triangle are now harder to give human values (lack of ability to apply Perceptual animacy). They seem just to be floating from one side to the other separated by the square with no real goal or intention.
prik;video_2;;;They were being pushed around like two objects in a box.
Pretzel;video_2;;;Two triangles move back and forth on a screen. They change their angle when they hit the rim of the screen.
pineconewithfeels;video_2;;;Two triangles were stuck bouncing between to walls, never reaching the room in the middle and never holding still. At the end, they suddenly passed through one wall and disappeared.
Patient HM;video_2;;;The video depicts some oldschool video game that has glitched.
p230;video_2;;;The blue triangle is now to the back of the box and the red one is in front of it. They move back and forth horizontally never leaving their own path. Every time they hit the side they go back and rotate on their own axis one move at a time. The red one rotates clockwise and the blue one anti clockwise
oma;video_2;;;The two triangles are inside a large square. they bounce back and forth between the left and the right sides. the blue in the upper half and the red in the lower half.
nulle;video_2;;;The two triangles were running/floating from side to side, it looked relaxing, bouncing from side to side
Neo;video_2;;;Two objects are bouncing back and forth in a room (never touching) in the same way that two rubber balls would. Finally, they zoom out of the room, through the wall
nemt;video_2;;;Two triangles, a big and a small, were bouncing back and forth in horizontal directions. There was a sort of no-gravity effect. In the middle they were separated by a square.
Nanna;video_2;;;The two triangles floated around and hit the walls
sfmsk;video_3;;;The mother paper plane is doing some kind of ritual/dance that the child paper plane observes and wants to copy. So the child follows the mother without her knowing it, however, the mother can maybe feel the child's presence and turns around and the child stops copying. Almost like the child was mocking the mother. The mother turns around and continues the dance ritual, and after getting suspicious one more time and afterwards continuing the ritual, she finally turns around to see the child copying/mocking her. She gets angry and the child storms out of the screen.
SD;video_3;;;The smaller one followed the bigger one but when the bigger one turned around, the smaller one acted as he just so happened to be there. Finally the bigger one confronted the smaller one and the smaller one ran away.
S;video_3;;;The triangles moved around, the big in front the small behind. When the small bump into the big, the big turns around suddenly (angry?). At the end the small run of through the left wall.
rss;video_3;;;The little triangle were trying to hide just behind the big triangle. every time the big triangle turned around it scolded the little triangle. at some point the big triangle got tired of it, and was very mad, which made the little triangle sad
Rønn;video_3;;;The small blue triangle followed the large red one. After avoiding numerous security checks, the small triangle eventually got caught
qwerty;video_3;;;The big triangle was pulsating and walked around the edges of the big box. Then the small triangle came in from the bottom screen and rushed after the big triangle. When it caught up it started mimicking the big triangle. Sometimes it would bump into the big triangle and the big triangle would turn around. At some point the big triangle had enough and seemed to get angry. The little triangle fled when the big triangle got angry.
qw1952;video_3;;;Castle guard's son (whose also an aspiring pickpocketer) comes to a bring your child to work day and shamelessly tries to steal from his fathers colleagues.
Queen;video_3;;;the little blue triangle was following the big red triangle, but the big red triangle did not want to be followed so it scared the little blue triangle off and it ran away
PSGslogLiverpool;video_3;;;The small triangle mirroring the large triangles movements and trying not to get caught. The small triangle is probably teasing the larger one. Maybe a sibling-kind og relationship
princess banana hammock;video_3;;;the baby triangle follows the mother triangle. The baby triangle doesn't want the mother triangle to know, and when she finds out the baby runs away (once again full on perceptual animacy)
prik;video_3;;;The little triangle mimicked the big one. It looked like it was bending its knees(if it had knees) and standing up again. In the end the little triangle rand away as the big one saw what it was doing.
Pretzel;video_3;;;A red triangle moves round the screen, shrinking and becomming bigger again in a steady rhytm. Then, a smaller triangle appears. It follows the same pattern as the big one. Every once in a while, the triangle stop the pattern and turn around. The animation ends when the small triangle goes off the screen.
pineconewithfeels;video_3;;;The bigger triangle was marching around. The smaller triangle decided to follow and mimic the bigger one, but whenever the big triangle turned around, the smaller one would pretend not to be doing anything. At the end, the smaller triangle accidentally walks into the bigger one and ends up fleeing from the bigger one's anger.
Patient HM;video_3;;;The small triangle follows the big triangle closely – to the great frustration of the big triangle. After getting caught three times, the small triangle gets threatened by the big triangle whereafter it flees the scene.
p230;video_3;;;The box is now gone and the red triangle moves along the sides. When it gets to the corner the blue one gets in the picture and follows the red one. Two corners ahead they spin 180 degrees but spin back again and continue in the same direction. They do this one more time and in the end the blue triangle goes out to the left
oma;video_3;;;"The red triangle enters the square from the left side then move around the square. the blue triangle enter from the lower side and then begins to follows the red triangle around. every now and then the red triangle turns to see if the blue triangle follows it - but the blue one just ""looks"" away. 
at one point the blue triangle hits the red one, and the red one turns and yells at it. after that, they both leave the square."
nulle;video_3;;;looking like a computer game, where the little triangle followed the bigger one and the bigger one did not like it! therefore it looked back a few times and they had a fight
Neo;video_3;;;A big entity is having a nice stroll around an area. A small entity appears and starts following the big entity. A few times, the big entity turns around, presumably because it noticed something. Each time, the small entity stops up and looks away, presenting not to do anything, but as soon as the big entity returns to walking, it starts following again. Finally the big entity turns around, scolding the small entity, and the small entity runs away.
nemt;video_3;;;The child triangle is following the bigger triangle around doing the exact same things. The parent triangle (big red one) is just chilling' around. When the kid accidentally touches the parent triangle in the end, it becomes angry and chases the child triangle out of the enclosed space.
Nanna;video_3;;;The small triangle imitated the big triangle and got scared when the big triangle discovered it
sfmsk;video_4;;;The mother and child paper plane bounces upon the walls again but this time not back and forth but more randomly, and exactly like the DVD logo I mentioned earlier. Only here there are two items/triangles/paper planes that bounce and sometimes they're pretty close to hitting each other and other times they bounce far away from each other. In the end they both float out of the screen through the walls they have been bouncing upon.
SD;video_4;;;The triangles were bouncing from wall to wall and it seemed sometimes as they would meet but the always passed each other untouched. Seemed as something that could be an analogy of two people's lives.
S;video_4;;;The triangles move around in the entire space.... Don't know
rss;video_4;;;The two triangles are looking for each other, but can't seem to find the other one, even though they goes right past each other at some points
Rønn;video_4;;;The two triangles moved sporadically around the field. Bouncing on the edges and almost colliding several times
qwerty;video_4;;;In this video the two triangles went all in on acting like pause screen bubbles, i.e. they they hit the edges of the big box, changed orientation and then bounced of the edge floating in a straight line until they hit another edge repeating the process. In the end they just flew straight through the edges of the box.
qw1952;video_4;;;Two casual acquaintances are having a night out in the 1980s, but the arcade machine seems to have some software bugs.
Queen;video_4;;;the triangles were just floating in space and they never met
PSGslogLiverpool;video_4;;;Triangles randomly bouncing around. There is no personalities in these animate objects.
princess banana hammock;video_4;;;The triangles now don't seem human and just floats around the space like the non-gravity targets in a game of bubble struggle game...
prik;video_4;;;they were being pushed around randomly or maybe more like floating.
Pretzel;video_4;;;Two triangles move around the screen in straight lines. When they hit the edge of the screen, they change movement direction and angle.
pineconewithfeels;video_4;;;Two triangles bounces around in the space between four lines like those obnoxious standby animations on some DVD-players. In the end, they float away.
Patient HM;video_4;;;This depicts a new concept of a Windows screen saver
p230;video_4;;;The two triangles move independently. Whenever they hit the side they bounces back in an angle responding to the angle they hit the side with and then they continue moving. In the end instead of bouncing back they keep moving and disappear from the picture
oma;video_4;;;the squares bounces from side to side all around the square - without hitting each other.
nulle;video_4;;;they were both floating around and it looks even more relaxing than the other video, they are floating slowly, just like airhockey
Neo;video_4;;;Two objects are bouncing around in a room, richocheting of the walls like two rubber balls would do, never touching each other. Eventually, they float out through the wall.
nemt;video_4;;;The triangles are floating around in a no gravity space. The walls surrounding them make them bounce off. They don't bounce in the expected direction though. It also seems like the direction is set so they always dodge each other.
Nanna;video_4;;;The triangles are floating around
sfmsk;video_5;;;"It looks like the mother and child paper plane have had an argument and that the mother wants the child to go back to his room/the ""nest"". So she forces him there but he wants to exit again, however, she won't let him. The child starts tickling the mother, which doesn't help the situation. She just gets more angry and the child returns to looking into the corner of the ""nest"". When the mother goes to the child, presumably to talk with him about their argument, maybe to resolve it, the child somehow escapes the ""nest"" and the screen and the mother is confused, looking for him."
SD;video_5;;;The bigger one  did not want the smaller one to get out of the room and after trying, the smaller one went to the corner and seemed to cry. The bigger one lost it's guard and came to see what's up and the smaller one had the chance to flee.
S;video_5;;;The big triangle move the small into the box. The small one tries to get out, but the big one blogs the way. The small triangle stroke the big one (giggles?) - the are tip to tip (happy?). The small one disappears. The big one is confused - searches for it.
rss;video_5;;;The big triangle tries to keep the little one inside the square, and it succeed until the little triangle starts to tickle the big one. then they fight for a while, but suddenly the little triangle starts to cry, and the big some comes to comfort it, but it was fake try and that way the little triangle escaped the square
Rønn;video_5;;;The small, blue triangle was confined to a cell by the large red one. Then it faked that it was crying and used this as a distraction to escape
qwerty;video_5;;;In this video, the big triangle pushed the little triangle into the box in the center and blocked the exit. The little triangle started to shake and tried to get out. At one point it was just shaking in the lower left corner. After it some time trying to get out it went to the upper left corner and started shaking there. The big triangle then approached it and also shook a little. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the little triangle ran out of the box and out of the screen. The big triangle followed outside, but couldn't see/find the little triangle, as it had already left the screen.
qw1952;video_5;;;Horrifying presentation of child labourers' working conditions in times of laissez faire capitalism. Only the sly survived, as demostrated by a successful subterfuge performed by a child worker, resulting in his escape.
Queen;video_5;;;The big red triangle tried to lock the little blue triangle into the small box but the little blue triangle wanted to get out so it tricked the big red triangle into letting it out and then escaped
PSGslogLiverpool;video_5;;;The small triangle was punished by the larger one. Perhaps for having done something stupid. And then the small triangle runs away and that stirs up the larger one.
princess banana hammock;video_5;;;the baby triangle is forced into the house by the mother and is kept there. It tries to escape by tickling the mother, but it doesn't work. At last the baby triangle escapes and the mothers go looking for it
prik;video_5;;;"The big triangle dragged the little triangle into the box and then blocked the  ""door"". Then the little triangle distracted the big one and ran out the door."
Pretzel;video_5;;;A small triangle enters a box through a hole. It moves towards the hole to exit the box, but the big triangle blocks the way. The big triangle enters the box, and the small triangle goes off screen.
pineconewithfeels;video_5;;;The small triangle is captured by the bigger one. Initially unable to escape, it comes up with a plan. It seduces/tricks the bigger triangle until it finally moves away from the door, then it escapes.
Patient HM;video_5;;;The big triangle forces the small triangle into the room and blocks the exit. The small triangle tries to escape by tickling the big triangle but this ultimately fails. It then manages to escape by luring the big triangle into the corner of the room and quickly exitting the door.
p230;video_5;;;The red triangle pushes the blue one into the box which is now back. The blue one tries to get out but the red is blocking the way. The red one pushes the blue further into the box but the blue gets past it, goes out the box and disappears from the picture. The red one goes out as well and starts spinning.

nulle;video_5;;;the big triangle is holding the smaller one trapped inside the box, and the little triangle want to get out, but it cannot, because the bigger one is blocking the exit
Neo;video_5;;;A big entity captures a smaller entity and puts it in a room, blocking the door so it can't escape no matter how hard it tries to pass. The small entity tickles the big entity, it rushes inside the room to scold the small one, and the small entity seizes the opportunity to flee the room and escape. The big entity rushes out, looking all around, but the small entity is nowhere to be seen.
nemt;video_5;;;The parent triangle sets baby triangle in a box. The baby triangle tries to escape the box, but the parent triangle forces the baby to stay inside by blocking the entrance. The baby triangle starts crying in the corner, and the parent triangle looks after it. But it was a trick! The baby triangle escapes the box and even the house (the confined space). The parent triangle is searching for the baby.
Nanna;video_5;;;The big triangle is holding the small triangle captive, but the small triangle tricks the big triangle by seducing it
sfmsk;video_6;;;"The mother and child paper planes bounce upon the walls once again, but this time the square/""nest"" is in the middle and they also bounce upon this. Sometimes they're close to hitting each other but they never do. It's quite similar to the previous bouncing video as it again looks like the DVD logo screensaver mentioned earlier."

Rønn;video_6;;;The two triangles danced sporadically around the cell in the middle, narrowly avoiding collision several times
qwerty;video_6;;;In this video, the triangles again kept bouncing of the edges of the big box, the three main differences being that this time the center box was also there, giving them all new bounce opportunities, they slowed down towards the end of the video and they stayed inside the big box.

PSGslogLiverpool;video_6;;;Random triangles bouncing around. :-)
princess banana hammock;video_6;;;the movements of the triangles again seem random and have no intentions. They just bob around the space with no gravity hold
prik;video_6;;;The triangles were just bouncing around randomly in the square.
Pretzel;video_6;;;Two triangles move around the screen. There is a box in the middle of the screen. Whenever the triangles hit the edge of the screen or the box, they change their direction of movement and angle.
pineconewithfeels;video_6;;;Two triangles bounce in circles around a small square room. They go in opposite directions. None of them float into the small room even though the smaller triangle might fit through the opening.
Patient HM;video_6;;;This represents the systematic but meaningless drifting through life that we all participate in.
p230;video_6;;;Again the triangles move independently and bounces back when they hit the wall. Now the box is there and they also bounce back when hitting this. They never touch each other and they never get into the box. In the end they slow down a little bit.
