11/16/2016 8:33:26,hashytag,"Two triangles are dancing inside a square. I consider the triangles to be two mice - a baby mouse and a mother mouse. The mother mouse clearly does not want the baby mouse inside the square. Maybe this is because the baby mouse has been a bad mouse? Never the less, the mother mouse eventually pushes the baby mouse out of the room. However, after finding out how lonely the baby mouse becomes, she pushes the baby mouse back into the square. Maybe she couldn't live with the shame of having pushed her baby mouse out from a square. ","Two triangles - or mice - are dancing a new dance. In this dance, the mice jumps from side to side. Every time the mother hits the side, she turns herself a bit clockwise. Every time the baby his the side, it turns itself a bit counterclockwise. This continues on and on. ","Two triangles - or mice - are playing a game. Or at least the baby mouse thinks that they are. He's following his mother mouse around, unaware of the fact that he's being a total douche. The mom does not like to play. When she finds out that the baby mouse is following her, she shouts and scolds at him. Poor baby mouse. ","This time, the baby mouse is once again following its mother around. It does not want to be alone. But it's slightly different this way. It's as if the two mice are just bouncing around endlessly, without ever crossing each others paths. And each time they hit one of the sides, they turn a little. ","Mother mouse is very disappointed in baby mouse, and therefore she locks it up. The baby mouse is completely incapable of escaping. Maybe he's been a very bad mouse. The baby mouse starts crying, and the mother comes to see it, but once she does that, she is tricked, and the baby mouse escapes the room. Bewildered, she follows after, only to be unable to find the baby mouse. ","The mouse do an alternative 'dancing around the christmas tree'. This consists of basically jumping around the living room, turning themselves around a bit each time they hit the wall. Great fun. "

It seems they have a nice relationship where they dance together and the mother pays a lot of attention to the child. However, the mother also wants the child to leave the ""nest"" or the square around the paper planes. So the mother shows the child how to exit it and the child copies it nervously. However, outside the ""nest"" they ""celebrate"" and join tips and dance together again. ","The mother and child paper plane bounce on the walls outside the square. They're playing some game and enjoying themselves. Maybe the mother is teaching the child how to play. They keep bouncing back and forth kind of like that DVD screensaver logo, where it bounces from side to side and you want it to hit the corner but it never does. In the end they float out of the screen through the wall they were previously bouncing upon. ","The mother paper plane is doing some kind of ritual/dance that the child paper plane observes and wants to copy. So the child follows the mother without her knowing it, however, the mother can maybe feel the child's presence and turns around and the child stops copying. Almost like the child was mocking the mother. The mother turns around and continues the dance ritual, and after getting suspicious one more time and afterwards continuing the ritual, she finally turns around to see the child copying/mocking her. She gets angry and the child storms out of the screen. ","The mother and child paper plane bounces upon the walls again but this time not back and forth but more randomly, and exactly like the DVD logo I mentioned earlier. Only here there are two items/triangles/paper planes that bounce and sometimes they're pretty close to hitting each other and other times they bounce far away from each other. In the end they both float out of the screen through the walls they have been bouncing upon. ","It looks like the mother and child paper plane have had an argument and that the mother wants the child to go back to his room/the ""nest"". So she forces him there but he wants to exit again, however, she won't let him. The child starts tickling the mother, which doesn't help the situation. She just gets more angry and the child returns to looking into the corner of the ""nest"". When the mother goes to the child, presumably to talk with him about their argument, maybe to resolve it, the child somehow escapes the ""nest"" and the screen and the mother is confused, looking for him. ","The mother and child paper planes bounce upon the walls once again, but this time the square/""nest"" is in the middle and they also bounce upon this.

Afterwards the small one forced the big one out of the square but he came back so the small one wanted to get out but the big one hold him but he managed to escape. In the end they both met outside and performed again the dance with holding each other with one corner.,There is a square in the middle and above it is a small triangle flying from wall to wall and bouncing from them.

At the beginning it seems that the smaller triangle is trying to mimic the trajectory of the bigger one but towards the end he gives up and is flying randomly.,First there appears a big triangle that is pulsing and flying. Then a smaller triangle appears and begins to chase the big one. After a moment the big triangle finds out that he is being chased and turns to the small triangle and seems to be angry about him. Then he turns back and flies again and also the small triangle starts to follow him again. Soon the big one again turns to the small one and it seems to me that he really does not want to be followed. Then he flies into the opposite corner and they appear to be fighting. The small triangle wins and flies away while the big one stays on the place and is just pulsing.,There were two triangles: big and small. And both of them just bounced from the walls in apparently random pattern. Often it seemed that they have to collide but it never happened eventhough it was really close miss. In the end both triangles just flew out of the sight.,First the big triangle is forcing a small triangle into the square but apparently the small one does not want to go there. But he loses the fight and is imprisoned inside and the big triangle is guarding the entrance. The small triangle is trying to escape but the entrance is fully blocked by the guardian. So he goes to the corner is thinks about what to do next. He comes to the guardian and tickles him and lurks him to go inside the square. When the guardian is inside the small triangle escapes. The video ends with big triangle outside the square where he is looking around where could the prisoner escape and seems to be confused about it.,"There are two triangles: red and blue. They are bouncing from the walls and from the square which is located in the center. They are bouncing around the whole scene and a couple of times they almost crash into each other but this never happens. Also sometimes it looks like one of the triangles will end up inside of the square but they always miss the entrance really closely. Most of the time they seem to be bouncing naturally but then once the blue triangle instead of bouncing straight back, as he should according the laws of physics he bounces to the side so it seems that the triangles can control their movement."

In the end they escaped and floated away in the same direction.","The red triangle was just walking slowly. Then the blue triangle came into the picture and started following the red one. When the red one turned around to check if someone was behind, the blue one acted as if it was doing something else. The blue did this twice, then on the thrid occasion it got busted but it just laughed, went away, stopped one more time before exiting, laughed again and then left.","Both triangles were just bouncing around. They never met. They might have been looking for the right spot, where they could leave the place and in the end they finally did it.","The big triangle tried to keep the small one inside the room. The small one tried to escape but couldn't find any way. Then it changed its strategie. It started to pet the big triangle, lured it into the room, then kissed it.

When the little triangle got scared the big triangle came out to the little triangle to show that it would always help the little triangle, and they they were dancing and hugging. The story is about children leaving the safe nest and being brave enough to go into the world on their own.","First the big triangle would follow the moves of the little triangle but later the positions change, so now the little triangle will follow in the footsteps of the big triangle. ","This seemed to me as an analogue for behavement of siblings. The little triangle see the big triangle doing this really cool movement, and wants to do the same thing. So it copies the big triangels moves but try to hide that it is doing it, so the big triangle wont get mad, but then when the big triangle discovers that the little triangle is copying it, it yells at the small triangle and the small triangle yells back and runs away - probably in tears. ","I think this is an analogue for siblings getting closer as they get older, because though they might start out very differently, they have to confront the same challenges and have to deal with the samme difficult stages of youth ( the sides of the square) and so they grow closer and closer as their starting point in life provide them with the same backpack of similar experiences. ","So the little triangle is teasing the big triangle. The big triangle take revenge by using its bigger size to trap the little triangle. The little triangle tries to hit the big triangle so it will let it out, but it dosent work. Then the small triangle uses a different approach. It tickles the big triangle until it eases up, and then run to a corner and pretend to be crying. When the big triangle comes to comfort the small triangle, the small triangle runs out of the room and hides. ","I think this is an analogy for that siblings can go through their entire life without ever crossing each others paths when they have left home, but they are both to some degree marked by their experiences/childhood/past so they will circle around the same choices and decisions in life and just barely miss each other.

They never hit the smaller square in the middle and never enter it, but when they hit the walls of the larger square they don't really move in the direction they logically should have if they had hit the wall that way (like when they hit the wall with a corner first they should then hit the wall with the side and jump back out from that angle).","The red triangle is sort of walking around in the square. Then the black triangle comes out and starts following the red triangle.

The red triangle takes the black triangle inside the smaller square and the black square lets go. Then, the red square blocks the exit so that the black square can't get out. It tries to poke the red triangle but it doesn't work. It stops for a while, and then tries again, this time sort of stroking the red triangle. It works and the red triangle moves so that the exit is open. I can't exactly remember what happens next but I think the two squares sort of make up and dance around inside the smaller square.

11/16/2016 10:57:20,27,"There are various ways to look at this. If one does not interpret anything, the video showed two triangles, one small, one big, moving around inside of a line, which had a shape of a room, looking at it from the top. The line was not closed, rather it had an opening. The triangles moved inside of this line and the big one moved outside a bit into the video. Eventually, the big one tried to push the small one outside (although that can already count as an interpretation - instead of a description). So going away from the descriptive side towards an interpretation, I think I saw two triangles, that interacted in a way that seemed like they were some kind of agent. They could be two persons or animals. The reason for this, is that their movements seemed very close to a situation in which for instance, a mother and a child are playing (when turning around a center point - as if holding each other's hands). Next, the mother agent (the big triangle) tries to get the small agent outside of the house (the line described above). But the child agent does not seem to want to go outside alone, since it is waiting for the other agent to come with him.","Two triangles were moving around inside a quadratic line - from left to right, always turning about 45 degrees whenever hitting a wall.
