_Write down your answers to the following questions while reading.  
We will discuss the answers in class._

# What is discourse
## Historical background of studies
**Big French thinkers from 1960s and 1970s**
Roland Barthes (cultural + literary theory)
Michel Foucault (history of science / history of ideas / historical archaeology)
Claude Levi-Strauss (anthropology)
Jacques Lacan (Psychoanalysis)


**In the 1970s and 1980s other trends of discourse studies showed up:**

**New social movements / Secondary Fronts** - feminism/colonialism focus etc
**Linguistic turn** - people began to think about linguistics in social sciences
**Analytical discourse studies** emerged in anglophone countries 1980/1990s (practical)


## What is discourse studies
**Theories** of what discourses are and what they do
**Analyses** of concrete discourses
**Discussions** of how we grasp the discursive in a concrete case

### Considerations 
**Ontological considerations: (theories of what the social is)**
- How the social is related to discourses
- What is power and how is it related to discourses
- What is identity and how is it related to discourses
**Epistemological considerations: (manifestation of the social)**
- How can we analyse discourses?
- How does power/identity etc. materialise?
**Methodological considerations: (how to analyse the social)**
- How do we best analyse discursive material

## Central questions in discourse studies
- IDENTITY
	- Hypothesis: identities are constructed discursively (have meaning and create meaning)
	- Both individuals, social groups and things have identities
	- Indendities are political (they are related in relations of dominance)
* IDEOLOGY and SUBJECTIVATION
	* SUBJECTIVATION = you are an individual, but you will be written into IDEOLOGY, by becoming a subject of the ideology
		* Discourses not only communicate meaning, they also **legitimize social practises**
	* Discourses create create relations of dominance between identities
	* Dominance is understood in terms of processes of subjectivation

**Discourse studies is an approach to the social that aim to identify, describe, analyse, criticise discursive constructions of relations of dominance between identities.**



**Question 1. Pages 36-37**

According to Keucheyan, what he terms the ”New Left” occured in Western Marxism, in the wake of a series of social uprisings in the 1960s, such as the May ’68 student uprisings in France, and a particular political engagement in these movements from the leftist thinkers of the time. Especially the rise of new political subjects and emancipations projects  - the so-called ”secondary fronts” (p. 36) - were central in this respect as they did not take the worker as their primary subject.  
  
Which social struggles can be categorized under this term?
>The new left is the changed their political subjects to be the secondary fronts: classes that face other kinds of oppression than that of capital or labour. By liberating the secondary fronts the superstructure of capitalism would be attacked from multiple fronts.  
>These classes could be minorities, colonized, women, homosexuals, prisoners, neurodivergents etc


**Question 2. Pages 38-42**

Keucheyan discusses the question of power, and the transformations it underwent with in the 1960s and 70s. From ”state power” (p. 38-39) in marxist writings it changed to ”micro-power” (p. 40-41) in Foucault. The latter being ”typical of the New Left”.  
  
Describe each of these two types of power and how they are different according to you.

_State power:_
The state is regarded as an institution of domination of the bourgeoisie, which the proletariat must consequently seize, and diminish its power. 


_Micro-power:_
In a micro-power framework the state doesn't produce its own power, but rather is the institution that has the capacity to seize the power. The power is described by Deleuze and Guattari as a rhizome (root network), and becomes a body without organs. This mirrors Foaucault disciplinary society, where "intermediate" institutions like school, church, and prison focuses the scattered micro-power into the state power.

_Central differences:_
In the state-power framework, the state is the producer of power, and can be seized through militarization. (stato-centrism)
In the micro-power framework the state is only the mediator and conquer of the power scattered in society through innate linguistics, culture and history.




**Question 3. pages 42-46.**

While the New Left is a politically engaged ”tradition”, structuralism is not. These two traditions did, however, merge in the vast majority of the theories emerging in France during the 1960s. Especially four main ”theoretical operations” from structuralism are important in this respect and would come to inspire some of these thinkers to develop a new concept of discourse.  
  
Identify these ”four main theoretical operations” underlying structuralism in the text and note them down below.

1. The model of structural linguistics (models of force in language)

2. Relativism - it critiques the truth that it engages in

3. Contingency in its relation to history 

4. Critique of the subject (anti-humanism, critique of the subject being "human")
