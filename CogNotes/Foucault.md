## POWER-CONCEPTS
**Foucault's two phases**
*Archaeological phase*: (early Foucault 1960s)
> what is discourse? what is knowledge? what is history?

*Genealogical phase*: (later Foucault 1980s)
> what is the subject? How does Power work on our bodies?
> The concept of Governmentality and  the concept of Biopolitics

(how the state exercises power on citizens)

**Archaeology vs Genealogy**

### Introducing power concepts:
**In traditional Marxism:**
Power is an oppressive negative force rooted in class clash.

Marxism (power is economics) -> Althusser (power is economy and ideology) -> Foucault (power is "ideology" of discourse)

**For Foucault:**
Power is not negative **but positive**:
- Power produces relations, knowledge, discourses
- Power cannot be fought, it is everywhere (constitutive of the social) (power is created)
- Foucault's power-concept is presented especially in the interview "Truth & Power" (1980)

We have to **deconstruct** power relations to identify how they work, but we can't get rid of them

**The new concept of power:**
* Power is productive
* Power creates discourses, identities, knowledge, it even affects our bodies
* Power has to be deconstructed to be identified
* This is what is called "micro-power" or **bio-power**

**Foucault's theory is "anti-essentialist"** =
that we do not have identity, we are identified. (this opposes the primacy of economy in Althusser)

**REFLECTION QUESTIONS**

Text: _Archeology of Knowledge_, Michel Foucault (1972) pages 40-49 + 113-117.

**Questions for pages 40-49 ”The Formation of Objects”.**

In this chapter, Foucault examines the emergence of what he calls ”objects”, that is, the object of an archeological study. As an example of such an object, Foucault takes the example of the discourse of psychopathology which he understands as a ”discursive formation” integrating various components, various discursive elements. By doing so he examines questions such as: How do discourses come into existance? By what means do they form a unity?

1.     Identify the three components (a-c) of the description of a discourse outlined by Foucault (pages 41-42) and note them here.
**Surface of their emergence** - (social relations that enables discourses to exist )
**Authorities of delimitation** - (the authorities/individuals that controls the phenomena/discourse)
**Grids of specification** - ()


2.     Generally, the foucauldian concept of ”discursive formation” is defined by its ”regularity in dispersion of elements”. This definition is in fact presented - yet formulated in another way - on page 44. How do Foucault formulate it here?

discursive formation is defined:
![[Pasted image 20220708084244.png]]

("discourse is characterized not by privileged objects, but by the way in which it forms objects that are in highly dispersed.")

3.     ”Discursive relations are not, as we can see, internal to discourse: they do not connect concepts or words with one another” Foucault states p. 46. If discursive relations are not relations between words, what are they then?

"{discursive relations} are, in a sense, at the limit of discourse: they offer the its objects of which it can speak, or rather (...) they determine the group of relations that discourse must establish in order to speak of this or that object, in order to deal with them, name them, analyse, explain, classify etc."

I.E.: when religion lost its discursive power as explainer of phenomena, the sciences were able to reach new heights, as subjects gained new frameworks of relations that could be used to describe the world. 



**Questions for pages 113-117 ”The Description of Statements”**

4.     How do Foucault define the statement? (page 115 top) and what is the relationship between the statement and the discursive formation? (page 115 in general).

A statement needs a: **referential** (principle of differentiation), **subject**, **associate field** (domain of coexsistens with other statements), a **materiality** (possibility of use).

Statements are interlinked in discursive formation (groups of statements), as signs are for a sentence.
But statements are as well interlinked in discursive formations in a temporal-location, and may therefore change meaning in the future as well.
A statement can't be analysed without considering the discursive formation.



5.     After having pinpointed the definition of the statement and the discursive formation and the relations between them, Foucault then presents his definition of the concept of discourse (p. 117). Note down the definition of the discourse-concept.

"a group of statements in so far as they belong to the same discursive formation; it does not form a rhetorical or formal unity, endlessly repeatable, whose apperacnce or use in history might be indicated (and, if necessary, explained); it is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of existence can be defined."

**Questions to be discussed further in class:**

6.     How can one understand the relationship between discursive formation, discourse and the statement?


7.     Why do you think Foucault calls his method an ”archeology”?

8.     What do you think people like Saussure would think about Foucault’s concept of discourse?
