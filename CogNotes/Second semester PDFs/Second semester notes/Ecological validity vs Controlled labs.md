## Behaviourism 
Humans are a "blank slate", and depending on reward and punishment we form our personality.

This of course is opposed by latent learning, where rats were seen to learn the layout of a maze, even without rewards.

## Genetics - 
### Nature vs Nurture
Humans learn as behaviourism suggested, but what we learn vary from our genetics.
We can try  to implement ways of remembering of being better at doing cognitive tasks, but we can have inherited genetical differences, that will never make two people equal in a task.

Human traits vary - **abnormal is normal** - this fact has to be accounted for (i.g. apply participant id as random factor)
