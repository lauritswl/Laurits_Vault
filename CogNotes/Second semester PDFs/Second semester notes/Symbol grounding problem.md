My own example of the symbol grounding problem has two versions, one difficult, and one, I think, impossible. The difficult version is: Suppose you had to learn Chinese as a second language and the only source of information you had was a Chinese/Chinese dictionary. The trip through the dictionary would amount to a merry-go-round, passing endlessly from one meaningless symbol or symbol-string (the definientes) to another (the definienda), never coming to a halt on what anything meant.

 The only reason cryptologists of ancient languages and secret codes seem to be able to successfully accomplish something very like this is that their efforts are grounded in a first language and in real world experience and knowledge

Levels of Turing tests:
t0: a chess program, that can play chess. A toy. 
t2: the verbal turing test:
You can talk with the robotic without ever realising its a computational machine.
t3: verbal and robotic - it should seem like a copy of what its imitating
t4: verbal, robotic and neurotic - it should have a copy of functional structure compared to what its imitating, e.g. if you bang it on the left side of the head it doesn't get aphasias, if you bang the right it gets aphasia.
t5: the machine is a complete copy of what it is immiating.
