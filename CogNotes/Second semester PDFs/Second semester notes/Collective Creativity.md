# Creativity:
Creativity is both a character trait, trait of product and a kind of process.


J.P. Guilford definition of "problem-solving-process"

**Divergent thinking: (creativity)**
Trying to produce multiple candidate solutions to a prompt
**Convergent thinking:**
The process of coming up with the single well established answer to a problem

A good way of problem solving would be generating ideas with divergent thinking and the singling out the best idea with convergent thinking.

To **measure creativity** use can use the alternative use test (Guilford 1967).
Here we code for fluency, originality and flexibility, as measures.
fluency - total number of sues
originality - uniqueness (how few total answers)
flexibility - how different uses are


Creativity as search:
Stuart Kaufmann (1939-) "The adjacent possible":
- an extension of the space of known/actual spaces
- can be reached by exploring the boundaries of the actual
- by exploring boundaries, a new space of idea would become the adjacent possible

##### Computational approaches to creativity:
***Exploration* versus *exploitation***
You can either search your already space of know for the best solution (exploitation).
Or - you can search for new adjacent possibility (exploration), which would expand known space and allow for a more optimal exploitation process.

The **optimal creativity** would arrive by **balancing exploration and exploitation** phases.
This idea mirrors the idea of creativity as mental search "information foraging".

A well defined space for investigating creativity.
