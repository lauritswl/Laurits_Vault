# Factor Analysis
Is the process of having a massive dataset, and with math compounding that data into a smaller dataset constituted of the hidden patters.
I.e. Simplifying large and complex data-set by **reducing number of dimensions**.

The idea behind factor analysis is that there are some hidden variables (factors) that are hidden, in larger data sets. Factor Analysis tries to find the hidden factors, and display them as the data set.

##  Explanatory factor analysis
You have no idea what your factors are before data analysis, and name those factors after analysis as a descriptor for something.

## Confirmatory factor analysis
You already have an idea of the factors that might be prominent in your field/data set. You can then afterwards name the factors according to the properties they show.
