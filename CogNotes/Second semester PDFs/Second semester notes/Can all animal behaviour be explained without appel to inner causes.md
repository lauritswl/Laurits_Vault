We can't know if animals have an inner state.

We can't be sure that even an inner state communicated from another human, prooves that they have an inner state.
With animals, we can't even communicate, but can only project our states of mind onto the animals in a biased case of [anthrpomorphism].
We can on the other hand focus on what variables effect the animal, and how the animal reacts in regards to these variables.

It's not simplified, we need to know entire history of variables affecting animal.
