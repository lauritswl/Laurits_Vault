# Behaviourism
## Behaviourism as a externalist paradigm
The other psychological fields of behaviourisms prime-time were in the internal paradigm. Meaning, that you have to look inside of the human experience to understand it.
**Psychoanalysis**: *Internal* structure of personality
**Gestalt**: *Internal* structure of perceptual experience
**Pragmatism**: *Internal* structure of goals and purposes

**Behaviourism** looks at *externalist structure* of actions. That is, how an environments reinforcement or punishment of actions changes behaviour.   

### Scientific rules/structure of behaviourism 
For behaviourism the goal isn't to understand the causes of an behaviour, as we can't dream to do that. **Behaviourism** aims to use **knowledge of independent variables** to **understand dependent variables**.
Science = Explanation, prediction, and control of the dependent variables.

In behaviourism you can therefore reduce behaviour/the mind to a set of variables.
We ignore the inner causes, and don't study the **mind/brain**, but the variables/behaviour present when these mental traits are active, **e.g.**:
‚Äú**wants**‚Äù = history of a high rate of reinforcement + lack of present reinforcement
‚Äú**believes**‚Äù = rate of behaviour consistent with prior reinforcement schedule

#### Operationalising of the mind:
1) External operation = independent variable 
2) Internal state = intervening variable 
3) Behaviour = dependant variable


## Types of conditioning
**A good refresher**:

### Classical conditioning
The classical conditioning is the type used on Pavlov's dogs.
When we use a **conditioned stimuli**, something we control as stimuli (abstract things like words, bells and so on), **paired with a natural response (unconditioned stimuli)**, fx food+salvating (response to unconditioned stimuli) and conditioned stimuli the bell ringing.

### Operant conditioning
Operant conditioning is when we pair a stimuli with a positive/negative stimuli, this could be praising someone whenever they do the dishes. This would resolve in the person connecting doing the dishes with positive feelings.
