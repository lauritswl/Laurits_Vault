# Computational theory of mind (CTM)
Could a machine think? Could the mind itself be a thinking machine? 
These are the ideas of *computationalists*, i.e. people who subscribe to the **computational theory of mind paradigm**. 

**The tasks of the computationalists:**
1. explain what one means when one says that the mind ‚Äúcomputes‚Äù
2. argue that the mind ‚Äúcomputes‚Äù in the relevant sense
3. clarify how computational description relates to other common types of description, especially _neurophysiological description_ and _intentional description_.

**Main ideas of the paradigm**:
- Observe effect of internal computations
- Ask which computational processes underlie cognition
- Control stimulus and infer computational operations
- Results support or disconfirm theories


**Computation is**: implementation-independent, formal symbol manipulation, that is systematically interpretable

## The classical computational theory of mind (CCTM)
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) first suggested that something resembling the Turing machine might provide a good model for the mind. In the 1960s, **CTM** became on of the most prominent paradigms in cognitive science. The computational paradigm moves away from [[Philosophy of behaviourism|behaviourism]], and uses internal states as an explainer. This shift was a result of technological advances and experimental results that indicate internal states was an variable for behaviour.
**The Turing machine:**
a machine capable of a finite set of configurations¬†$q_1$$,‚Ä¶,$$q_n$
contains a symbol¬†$S_1$, ‚Ä¶ ,$S_n$ where¬†$S_1$=0 and $S_2$=1.
A Turing machine is capable of three types of action:

1.  Print¬†$S_i$, move one square to the left (_L_) and go to state¬†$q_i$
2.  Print¬†$S_i$, move one square to the right (_R_) and go to state¬†$q_i$
3.  Print¬†$S_i$, do not move (_N_) and go to state¬†$q_i$

### Empirical interventions against [[Philosophy of behaviourism|behaviourism]]

Tolman (Tolman rat in maze develops cognitive maps) and Thorndike (Thorndike's cat in box experiment)- the rat remembers the maze, and then retrieves those memories (internal state of memory). 
Stroop and the Stroop-effect indicates that mental processes (resources) are limited to an internal state and not behaviour. 
Processes is limited is limited by [[Short-term memory (STM)#^chunking|chunking (George A. Miller)]].


## [[Neural Networks]]
**Eliminative connectionists** advance connectionism as a **rival to classical computationalism**. They argue that the Turing formalism is irrelevant to psychological explanation.

**Implementationist connectionism** is a more ecumenical position. It allows a potentially valuable role for both **Turing-style models _and_ neural networks**, operating harmoniously at **different levels of description**.
