Regulation The use of feedback by another system (or part) to impose constraints on a system

Embodied cognitive science claims:

Cognition should not be explained computationally, but by using the anatomy and physiology of the body and brain 

Not just the brain, but the body too, makes important causal contributions to cognition and behaviour 

The body (a) constrains, (b) distributes, and (c) regulates cognition â€“ Brain, body, and environment function as a mutually constraining dynamical system supporting cognition

Cognitive development thus involves carving out individual solutions by forming stable attractors in state space
