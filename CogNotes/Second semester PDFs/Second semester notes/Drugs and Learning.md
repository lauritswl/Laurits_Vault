**The effects of drugs on cognition**
___
## Drugs
**Drugs**: are substances, natural or synthetic, that produce physiological
changes when taken into the body.
**Psychoactive drugs** alter activity at nervous system synapses. Drugs can impact [[Neurons#^659999| Neurotransmitters]] either directly or indirectly. An **agonist** increases the action of a given neurotransmitter whereas an **antagonist** decreases or blocks it.

### Social Drugs
Social drugs are everyday use drugs like caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.
""Smoking has important social dimensions and is a complex behaviour that is used by smokers in different ways and to fulfil different needs (Graham, 1994; Collins et al., 2002).""
#### Caffeine
Caffeine is an alkaloid that belongs to a class of chemicals known as the methylxanthines. It acts to increase nervous system arousal and is an **antagonist** *for adenosine*. Adenosine is important in the sleep/wake cycle, it tells us we are tired by inhibiting neural activity.


### Illicit Drugs
Illicit drugs include cannabis, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy, and all have a high potential for abuse.
