Paper regarding **pragmatism** by Charles Pierce - *Fixation of Belief*
## The fixation of belief
The paper starts of with:
> "Few persons care to study logic, because everybody conceives himself to be proficient enough in the art of reasoning already"

But it turns out very few people don't fall into the fallacies of reasoning and logic.
Humans tend to be poor reasoners in subjects regarding matters we are unfamiliar with.


**The main takeaway from the paper is**:
Pierce discusses four ways that you can remove **doubt**, and advocates that the scientific methods is the best.


#### Doubt vs Belief
We cant by introspective means differentiate between doubt and belief.
We **infer** from **observable differences** that we (I) believe rather than doubt or (II) doubt rather than believe.

**First difference**:
When we **doubt** we are **inclined** to ask questions. When we **believe** we are **inclined** to **make a statement** that something is true. 

**Second difference:**
When we **doubt** we are not inclined to act in a **habitual** way. When we **believe** our actions **are habitual** and guided by that belief.

**Third difference:**
When we doubt we dissatisfied or uncomfortable. In belief we are calm and satisfied, and don't try to move out of that belief.

##### Inquiry
If **belief** is a habit of action and **doubt** is a stimulus to action, then **inquiry** is the *struggle* caused by the *irritation of doubt* to *attain a state of belief*.

Doubt -> Irritation (stimulus) -> Inquiry (struggle) -> Belief 

**Inquiry** is the ultimate goal of reaching a fixed belief.


**Three key propositions:**
1. The nature of belief is habit (if X, then Y)
2. Inquiry is struggle to remove doubt
3. The fixation of belief is the sole goal of inquiry


## Pierce's four proposed methods
### The method of tenacity 
If you have believe **P**, shut out anything that might cause you to doubt **P**.
* Find evidence that supports **P** and shut out anything that conflicts with **P**.


If you don't seek anything that questions your belief, you will be able to live a happy life without seeking truth. Nevertheless you will find different beliefs at some point, and if you aren't sure of your reasoning, this will be a wavering of your world-view.
The method of tenacity can work for a single individual, but when introduced to a social setting it won't work. And a method that can fix the beliefs of everyone in a community is therefore needed.



### The method of authority 
The **method of authority** aims to fix belief through **indoctrination** and **force**.
This method is very **effective and far superior** to the **methods of tenacity**.
Like the methods of tenacity this methods is also against the social impulse of man, as we will meet people from other periods of time through art and people from other authorities, we will notice that they have beliefs differentiating from ours. We will then undoubtedly begin to doubt or belief, and the method will fail. 

The states/ the general view on a subject (**P**) will tend to rub of its belief onto the average citizen. 

### The a priori method
Our beliefs are fixed by the unimpeded natural preferences or reflections:
- Doubt is destroyed by finding propositions (**P**) that are agreeable to reason.
**The a priori method** differs from the **method of authority** by using reasoning and appealing to the internal forces in opposition to the external forces of the method of authority. 

But the a priori method is not useful for permanently fix our belief, as it appeal to our internal forces, that will switch over time along with our intellectual taste. When a paradigm of e.g. religion switches our internal intellectual taste will taste along it, and we will then need new views to fix our belief.

>You try to induct rules based on your previous observations:
>All swans I have seen are white, so all swans are white.
>This approach is questioned when you travel to Australia, and see a black swan. You will then be forced to update your belief.


### The scientific method
Pierce doesn't elaborate deeply on **the scientific method**, but he mentions to factors regarding the method:
In contrast to the other methods that really on factors internal to subjects, the scientific method have an external permanency (out though have no influence).
This external permanency is a public available thing, so no matter who uses the scientific method will come to the same proposition (**P**).

**To simplify:**
There is a publicly acceciable external permanency or reality, of which our thought have no effect, that is capable to influence us in according to regular laws. We can interact with this permanency to take us from a place of doubt to a state of belief.
