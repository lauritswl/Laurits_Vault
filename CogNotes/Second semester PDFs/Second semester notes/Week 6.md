# Data and measurement
In the last few years the quantitative amount of data have increased quikly.
This is a result of more people getting a computer/social media/phone etc. 
This data might also be of a poor quality, and if your data is of low quality, your model will also be of poor quality.


## Aspects of data quality:
* **Validity:**
	* Construct validity (When you are not measuring what you think you are measuring)
	* Face validity (If data seems to imply a result at first look)
	* Ecological validity (Generalization to the real world)
* **Reliability:**
* **Sample selection** (Representativeness of the population, e.g. WIERD)


## Aspects of graph quality
All graphs are comparisons
* Scatterplots
* Histograms / Distrubution plots
* Raindrop plot / Boxplot / Violin
* Pie Chart (good for dumbing somthing down) / Bar chart
