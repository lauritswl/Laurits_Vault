"We may call this the **subjective** character of experience. It is **not** captured by any of the familiar, recently devised **reductive analyses** of the mental, for all of them are logically compatible with its absence. It is not analyzable in terms of any explanatory system of functional states, or intentional states, since these could be ascribed to robots or automata that behaved like people though they **experienced nothing**." Nagel
