## Origin of Intelligence Testing
Intelligence Testing was developed to identify children in need of extra study help.
This was firstly used in 1905, and was misused in in its early stages.
This early test was only used for getting an idea regarding ability to learn in a school test.

Later it was found that there were multiple types of intelligence, showing a signs of correlation between the different types of intelligence. This correlation indicates there might exist a general intelligence score, varying what types of intelligences you have an amplitude for. 

### Different concepts of intelligence
"Viewed narrowly, there seem to be almost as many definitions of intelligence as there were experts asked to define it"
-R. J. Sternberg
