# What is computationalism
Computationalism is often regarded as:
> "**Computation is cognition**, and vice versa"

## The war of the ghosts
### As a proof of mentalisation overriding computation
>"experiment called ‚Äú*War of the Ghosts*‚Äù (1932), which demonstrated the constructive nature of memory and the influence of cultural schemas."

In this experiment a retelling of a story will follow a cultural schema, and the story will be changed by your culture. This could be interpreted as your memories not being a computational symbol and thus being episodic scripts being put together.

This is in opposition to computationalism turning machine way of processing, [[Knowledge#Script theory Schank Abelson 1977|Script theory by Schank and Abelson, 1977]] explains schema based memory, these scripts can be thought of as computation (implementation-independent, systematically interpretable symbol manipulation). A computer was programmed to understand a story like a person by using script based memory degradation/manipulation. 

**The computer that passed the turning test by using scripts**: 
Searle, John. R. (1980) Minds, brains, and programs. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 3 (3): 417-457
**Story**: 
A man went into a restaurant and ordered a hamburger. When the hamburger arrived it was burned to a crisp, and the man stormed out of the restaurant angrily, without paying for the hamburger or leaving a tip.

**Question**: Did the man eat the hamburger?

**Answer without script understanding:** How would I know, you didn't tell me.

**Answer with script understanding**: Of course not, he didn't pay or leave a tip, and it was burned to crisps.

If a computer understood this script, it was able to pass the turning test. This computers ability to imitate cognition paired with the Chinese room was used as a argument against computation.

### Chinese room as a rebuttal to computationalism (by John Searle)
The Chinese room does computation, (implementation-independent, systematically interpretable symbol manipulation), if the script robot does answer correctly, that doesn't mean it understands the question. 

Depending on whether you see the Chinese room as understanding/cognition, two conclusions can be made about computationalism.

If you think the Chinese room is understanding, then computationalism/script model is understanding.
or the opposite.  

Output from Chinese room =/= understanding inside the Chinese room.

By showing that the Chinese room isn't understanding, we also say that the turning test doesn't prove intelligence of AI, but merely shows similarity to understanding.
