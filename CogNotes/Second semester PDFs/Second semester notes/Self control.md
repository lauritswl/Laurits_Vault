# Self-control: Language and self-talk
**The mind is a hierarchical control system:**

The capacity to exert self-control works like a muscle.
The more we practice self-control, the more the self-control capacity will increase.
Exerting self-control will lead to temporary exhaustion (**ego depletion**)


### Ego Depletion
The state at which we have used so much willpower and mental energy that our self-control is impaired
--> Limited amount of mental energy and willpower 
--> Exhausting these resources will deplete self-control
--> giving into temptations (not practicing self-control)
--> You will be more likely to make the worse decision.


### Language and self-control
**How language help with self-control:**
**Attention** - what aspects of the situation are most relevant?
**Motivation** - Why am I doing this? What is my end goal?
**Regulation** - Am I doing my best? How might I change my behaviour?



**Inner-speech is the outcome of a developmental process.**
