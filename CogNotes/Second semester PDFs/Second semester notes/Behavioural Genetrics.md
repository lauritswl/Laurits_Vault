title: KEY CONCEPTS
**Gene**: Basic unit of heredity. A sequence of DNA bases that codes for a particular product.

**Allele**: Alternative form of a gene.

**Genotype**: An individual‚Äôs combination of alleles at a particular locus.

**Phenotype**: Observed or measured traits.

**Dominant allele**: An allele that produces the same phenotype in an individual regardless of whether one or two copies are present.

**Recessive allele**: An allele that produces its phenotype only when two copies
are present.

**Chromosome**: A threadlike structure that contains DNA and resides in the nucleus of cells. Humans have 23 pairs.

**Locus (plural, loci):** The site of a specific gene on a chromosome. Latin for ‚Äúplace.‚Äù

**Linkage**: Loci that are close together on a chromosome and thus inherited together within families. Linkage is an exception to Mendel‚Äôs second law of independent assortment.

**Recombination**: A process that occurs during meiosis in which chromosomes exchange parts.

**Codon**: A sequence of three bases that codes for a particular amino acid or the end of a transcribed sequence.

**Transcription**: The synthesis of an RNA molecule from DNA in the cell nucleus.

**Translation**: Assembly of amino acids into peptide chains on the basis of information encoded in messenger RNA. Occurs on ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm.

# Behavioural Genetics
## Genetrics:
**Genetic code** contained in the sequence of **DNA** bases, **DNA** is responsible for heredity traits. **DNA** wraps around **chromosomes**, where humans have 23 pairs.

### Mendel's Laws
#### First law - law of segregation
You will receive on of two **genes** from parents, these can be either a dominant or recessive **allele**.
The combination of your two **alleles** is your **genotype**. Whereas the expressed trait is your **phenotype**.
#### Second law - law of independent assortment
The inheritance of one gene is not affected by the inheritance of another gene. However, genes that are closely linked on the same chromosome can co-assort, thus violating Mendel‚Äôs law of independent assortment. Such violations make it possible to map genes to chromosomes by using linkage analysis.
