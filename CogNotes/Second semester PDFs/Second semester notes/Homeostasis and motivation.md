# Homeostasis and motivation
## Homeostasis 
Homeostasis refers to the processes that maintain the internal environment of the body within a narrow physiological range. 

*Homeostasis* - **Trying to stay the same**

The hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating the body's homeostasis:
* The hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis starts with sensory transduction
	* A regulated parameter (e.g., temperature) is measured by specialized sensory neurons.
	* Deviations from the optimal range is detected by neurons concentrated in the **periventricular zone of the hypothalamus**.
	* The neurons then orchestrate an integrated response to bring the parameter back to its optimal value:
1. **Humoral response :** 
  Hypothalamic neurons respond to sensory signals by stimulating or inhibiting the release of pituitary hormones into the bloodstream.
2. **Visceromotor response :**
  Neurons in the hypothalamus respond to sensory signals by adjusting the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
3. **Somatic motor response :** 
  Hypothalamic neurons (particularly within the lateral hypothalamus) respond to sensory signals by inciting an appropriate somatic motor behavioural response.
### Lipostatic hypothesis
The lipstatic hypothesis was first proposed by Gordon Kennedy in 1953. It states that your brain monitors the amount of bodyfat and tries to "defend" this energy store. So if you either fast or overeat in a period, the body will return to it's regular level afterwards: [[Lipostatic_Hypothesis_in_mice.png|Lipostatic Hypothesis in mice]]
A bloodborne hormonal signal was found to be responsible for this by Douglas Coleman in the 1960s: The DNA of one strain of an obese mouse lacked both copies of a gene called **ob** (Therefore the mice were called **ob/ob mice**).
When the mice lacked the ob/ob gene, the brain was tricked into thinking the mice's fat reserves was low, and increased hunger. The hormone *leptin* produced by the gene could be injected in the ob/ob mice, to regulate the mice's weight. Leptin admissions in people/mice with normal levels doesn't seem to have further weight loss effects. 

#### Conclusion on leptine:
**A rise in leptin levels**: stimulates the **release of $\alpha$MSH and CART** from
arcuate nucleus neurons. These anorectic peptides act on the brain, in
part by **activating the MC4 receptor**, to *inhibit feeding behavior and
increase metabolism*.

**A fall in leptin levels:** stimulates the release of **NPY and AgRP** from
arcuate nucleus neurons, and the **release of MCH and orexin** from neurons
in the lateral hypothalamic area. These **orexigenic peptides act on
the brain** to *stimulate feeding behavior and decrease metabolism*.

If your homeostasis is out of balance, the quickest way to regain balance is through motivated behaviours, like eating, drinking or seeking warmth.
### A feedback control system
A **feedback control system** is trying to decide when an **effector unit** should **change** the **external system** (the world). The external system is sampled via **sensor(s)**. Sensor input is compared to a reference (*set point*) in **controller unit** (the unit that compares internal set point to external systems). If there is a  difference (*deficit signals*), then this leads to motivated action.

In opposition to thinking of a set point, another idea is that of a **settling point**.
A settling point as a stable state caused by the balance of opposing forces, but without any set point or error detection. **In eating behaviour** this would be determined not only by internal appetite and satiety mechanisms, but also by external availability and taste of foods.

By introducing anticipation, we can start preparing fx food shopping, before we arrive at hunger, to get a settling point closer to our internal set point.

## Motivation
Motivation can be seen as the driving force of behaviour; it is required for a certain behaviour **but** it doesn't force that behaviour.

**Motivation is caused** by our **feedback systems** trying to return to a **homeostatic set point**: or trying to reach a **settling point**.

Fx we can investigate the behavioural and cognitive ideas of when we drink water:

### Behavioural reinforcers
**A reinforcer is a stimulus** that increases or decreases a particular pattern of behaviour (i.e. *has value*)
* **Primary** (or *unconditioned*) reinforcers do not need to be learned (e.g. *certain tastes, smells, sensations*)
* **Secondary** (or *conditioned*) reinforcers are learned through a coupling with a primary reinforcer (e.g. *Pavlovâ€™s dogs*)

#### **Berridge distinguishes two incentive (motivating) processes** 
* *â€˜wantingâ€™* (motivational incentive value, expectancy based reward) 
* â€˜likingâ€™ (hedonic impact, consummatory reward

These two components of reward have different brain mechanisms.
