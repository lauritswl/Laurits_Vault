### Arithmetic 
**The summation operator**
if $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ are n numerical values, then their sum can be notated as $\ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} X_i$.

**The product operator**
if $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ are n numerical values, then their product can be notated as $\ \prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.


### Notation
See [[Symbols|Link]] for a list of logical symbols for explaining logical statements

### Functions
```ad-info
title: **Properties of Functions, given for $g(x) = y$**
- A function is **continuous** if it has no ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in its mapping (the set of values) from $x$ to $y$.
- A function is **invertible** if its reverse operation exists: $g ‚àí1 (y) = x$, where $g ‚àí1 (g(x)) = x$.
```

### Polynomials
$f(x) = \pm x^a$ $\pm x^b$
