## The demarcation between science and pseudoscience
The [[Glossary#Demarcation|demarcation]] between science and pseudoscience is part of the larger task of determining which beliefs are [[Glossary#Epistemically|epistemically]] warranted.

Science cannot critically examine itself, that is the problem of philosophy; science is not able to answer what is, perhaps, the most important question about itself: *what is science?*

##### Demarcation criterion
To find out what science is, it requires finding a criterion - some standard or measure - that all science meet, and all non-science fails to meet. Such a criterion would demarcate science from non-science.

Pseudoscience is non-science that presents itself as, pretends to be, or masquerades science.
