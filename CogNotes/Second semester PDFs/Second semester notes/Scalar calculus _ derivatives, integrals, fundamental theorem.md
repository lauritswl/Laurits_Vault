### Fundamental theorem
Area under function f(x), between x of *a* and *b*:
![[Fundemental theorem.png]]
$$Area=F(b)-F(a)$$
$$with \space F'(x)=f(x)$$
If the curve goes below zero, you have to calculate two areals, splitting at where the function crosses $y=0$

$A=\int_a^b \! f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x= F(b) - F(a)$
Geomtric interpretation as area under the curve only works if $f(x) \geq 0$
