# Falsificationism
### The failure of verificationism:
Verificationism has both a [[Demarcation#Demarcation criterion|demarcation criterion]] and a scientific methodology. 
The demarcation criterion holds that all and only empirical verifiable sentences are meaningful and scientific.
The scientific methodology holds that science ought only to be practiced by attempting to prove hypotheses true using only empirical evidence.

But given empirical data can only serve to make a hypothesis more probable and never prove it true, then true verification is in terms of certainty is impossible.

### Karl Popper (1902-1994)
Karl popper introduced the theory of falsification as an opposition to verificationism and induction.
Falsificationism was specifically an opposition to widespread scientific claims in psychology and sociology.
"Science makes risky predictions that could *possibly* disprove some scientific hypotheses, (even if they don't actually end up disproving something.)"

#### Falsifiability as the demarcation criterion
According to falsificationism, a field of science is only a science if it makes claims that could *possibly* be proven false via empirical means, and a claim is only scientific if that claim could *possibly* be proven wrong via empirical means.  

Each empirically testable hypothesis has **one or more** test *implications* (things that will be true if the hypothesis is true). Hypotheses must be tested through their *implications*. If an implication is tested, and turns out to be false, we know the hypothesis is false.

#### Central problem of falsificationism
It is impossible to ever falsify any hypothesis with empirical evidence.
It might seem like empirical evidence can falsify a hypothesis, Pierre Duhem noticed that falsification might not be as simple as Popper thought. 
Hypotheses are never tested in isolation - (on their own) - but accompanied by an infinitely large amount of auxiliary assumptions (things that are assumed but not tested for) in the process of testing. This is called the **Quine-Duhem Thesis**.

Popper was right about the faults of verificationism, but a further investigation needed to be done, to reach modern scientific praxis.
