Description: What are the laws?
Explanation: How does it work?

How do we explain psychological effects?:
**Five explanatory frameworks**
1. Computational symbol processing explanations
2. Connectionist explanations
3. Neuroscience explanations
4. Evolutionary explanations
5. Belif Desire Intention (BDI) explanations (not part of this course)


| Physics                          | Psychology                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| What are the laws?               | How does it work?               |
| Laws apply always and everywhere | Laws in situ (called ‘effects’) |
|                                  |                                 |

According to Cummins (2000), explanation and prediction are independent notions.
**Prediction without explanation** 
“Can a system be predictable without being understood?” 
**Explanation without prediction**
“Can a system be well-understood yet unpredictable?”

**Capacities versus effects**
 Capacities are primary explananda
 Effects help constrain explanations
 Capacities need not be discovered 
 
**Specifying capacities is**:
