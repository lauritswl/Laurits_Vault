# Active Inference: The Hype
## The free energy principle
Any **thing** will *look as if it minimizes free energy*. 
**The thing** is **Self organizing system, adaptively behaving agent, living thing**, that will be describable as if:
*Its internal states minimizes variational free energy with respect to external states.*
*Its actions minimize expected free energy with regard to some model of the environment.*

**Two things to be a thing**:
*Borders*: The Markov Blanket
*Stability*: The (non-equilibrium) steady state

**Divergence**:
Information theoretic surprisal
**Free energy** > surprisal
