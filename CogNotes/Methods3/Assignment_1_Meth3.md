# Assignment 1
**Autistic**
* Mean at V1: log(50)
* Average individual deviation: 30
* log(50)–log(50-30)

- Mean increase: 10% (0.1)
- Average individual deviation: 0.05

**Typically developing**
- Mean at V1: log(50)
- Average individual deviation: 20
- log(50)–log(50-20)

- Mean increase: 20% (0.2)![[Priors for assignment 1.png]]
- Average individual deviation: 0.03

## Assignment 1 - wrap up
**Q1 -** 
Briefly describe your simulation process, its goals, and what you have learned from the simulation. Add at least a plot showcasing the results of the simulation. Make a special note on sample size considerations: how much data do you think you will need? what else could you do to increase the precision of your estimates?

**Q2 -** 
Briefly describe the empirical data and how they compare to what you learned from the simulation (what can you learn from them?). Briefly describe your model(s) and model quality. Report the findings: how does development differ between autistic and neurotypical children (N.B. remember to report both population and individual level findings)? **Which additional factors should be included in the model (cue: model comparison!)?** Add at least one plot showcasing each of your key findings.

**Optional: Q3 -** 
Given the model(s) from Q2, how well do they predict the data? Discuss both in terms of absolute error in training vs testing; and in terms of characterizing the new kids' language development as typical or in need of support.
