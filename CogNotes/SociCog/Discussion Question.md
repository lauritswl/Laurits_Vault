*How does the conceptual framework of social learning (from Rendell et al) compare with that of social cognition from week 1? How does it relate with the idea of information integration presented in Simonsen et al?*  





Which picture of social cognition emerges from the Sasson et al paper? Does it fully overlap with your readings from the previous week? How can we explain the lack of high predictability of social skills from social cognition? Comment on whether you would have made different choices of tasks.  



What can we learn from the literature on social learning? 


For each of the two video presentations identify: 1) the question; 2) the experimental design that allows to test the question; 3) the statistical model that assesses the evidence.
