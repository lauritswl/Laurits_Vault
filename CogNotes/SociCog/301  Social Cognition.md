the cognitive processes that underlie social interactions, including perceiving, interpreting and responding to social information, such as the behaviours and intentions of others.

Social cognition regards individuals doing information processing about: 
* information about each other (ToM)
* information in a social context (social simon effect)
* information with another people (dialogically extended mind)

[[Discussion Question]]



The increased brain size of humans have been attributed to two hypotheses:
	- [[General intelligence hypothesis]]
	- [[Social- or Cultural Intelligence hypothesis]]
[[Anthropomorphism]] is also a problem when looking at a group of people

Social cognition as the processing of information related to others 
- Observational vs. active 
- Explicit vs implicit 
- Specific vs. generic 
- Individual vs. interpersonal



# Cultural transmission and evolution:
### Culture can be defined as:
> Information or behaviour - shared by a population or subpopulation - which is acquired from conspecifics through some form of social learning
- Rendell and Whitehead, 2001


Cumulative cultural evoultion (CCE)
- Gradual accumulation of knowledge over time
- Cultural transmission as a **framework to investigate** certain behavioural phenomena 
	- e.g. broken whisper game - where a sentence changes greatly after a few chain links.
- Social

What research questions do you think they were trying to address? How do the methods used enrich our understanding of the evolution of symbolic behaviour? 
Consider what questions and methods you would use if you were going to design an experiment on a similar topic that used materials from the archaeological record.



# Social Learning / 
#### Social learning strategies: modelling devices:
Simplest possible model is the contagion model -> copy other based on a certain threshold of exposure.
Otherwise more complex contagion models can be used:
	- Success bias
	- Prestige bias
	- Similarity bias

**Social learning: underused or overhyped?**
*Rendell*: Copying other is the best strategy, and therefore beats asocial-individual learning in most conditions.

Chains of transmission - information flow is very depending on the structure of the network.
If the network is to connected the network will tend to exploit the information-space to early, and loose the chance to explore cultural inventions that allow for better exploitation.
