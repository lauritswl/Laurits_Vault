# Teamwork
2 or more people engaged in a common activity

Teamwork is better than individual problem-solving when:

**The  information provided by the interacting agents is:**
- Different from other agents information
- Complementary (different errors and information)
- Somewhat reliable (or reliability should be communicated with information)
- 


### Equality bias
- People across cultures tend to (stubbornly) listen to each other.
	- Therefore, if they are differently able (one good, one bad), their performance suffer 
	- Message: cooperate only with similar people, or at least weigh information according to performance.
	- Equality bias is a Social counter measure to Dunning-Kruger effect, that would give the least confident people the heaviest weighing information.
#### Optimal Joint Decisions
I should follow you depending on how your performance compares to mine
- The better you are (compared to me), the more I should follow you
- The worse you are (compared to me), the less I should follow you
